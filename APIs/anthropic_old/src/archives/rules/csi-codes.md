Supported Terminal Sequences

xterm.js version: 5.1.0

General notes
This document lists xterm.js' support of terminal sequences. The sequences are grouped by their sequence type:

- C0: single byte command (7bit control codes, byte range `\\x00` .. `\\x1F`, `\\x7F`)
- C1: single byte command (8bit control codes, byte range `\\x80` .. `\\x9F`)
- ESC: sequence starting with `ESC` (`\\x1B`)
- CSI - Control Sequence Introducer: sequence starting with `ESC [` (7bit) or CSI (`\\x9B`, 8bit)
- DCS - Device Control String: sequence starting with `ESC P` (7bit) or DCS (`\\x90`, 8bit)
- OSC - Operating System Command: sequence starting with `ESC ]` (7bit) or OSC (`\\x9D`, 8bit)

Application Program Command (APC), Privacy Message (PM) and Start of String (SOS) are recognized but not supported, any sequence of these types will be silently ignored. They are also not hookable by the API.

Note that the list only marks sequences implemented in xterm.js' core codebase as supported. Missing sequences are either not supported or unstable/experimental. Furthermore addons or integrations can provide additional custom sequences (denoted as \"External\" where known).

To denote the sequences the tables use the same abbreviations as xterm does:

- `Ps`: A single (usually optional) numeric parameter, composed of one or more decimal digits.
- `Pm`: Multiple numeric parameters composed of any number of single numeric parameters, separated by ; character(s), e.g. ` Ps ; Ps ; ... `.
- `Pt`: A text parameter composed of printable characters. Note that for most commands with `Pt` only ASCII printables are specified to work. Additionally the parser will let pass any codepoint greater than C1 as printable.

Set Windows Title and Icon Name
Icon name is not supported. For Window Title see below.

Set Windows Title
xterm.js does not manipulate the title directly, instead exposes changes via the event `Terminal.onTitleChange`.

Set ANSI color
`c` is the color index between 0 and 255. The color format of `spec` is derived from `XParseColor` (see OSC 10 for supported formats).
There may be multipe `c ; spec` pairs present in the same instruction.
If `spec` contains `?` the terminal returns a sequence with the currently set color.

Create hyperlink
`uri` is a hyperlink starting with `http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`, `file://` or `mailto://`. `params` is an
optional list of key=value assignments, separated by the : character. Example: `id=xyz123:foo=bar:baz=quux`.
Currently only the id key is defined. Cells that share the same ID and URI share hover feedback.
Use `OSC 8 ; ; BEL` to finish the current hyperlink.

Set or query default foreground color
To set the color, the following color specification formats are supported:

- `rgb:<red>/<green>/<blue>` for  `<red>, <green>, <blue>` in `h | hh | hhh | hhhh`, where
  `h` is a single hexadecimal digit (case insignificant). The different widths scale
  from 4 bit (`h`) to 16 bit (`hhhh`) and get converted to 8 bit (`hh`).
- `#RGB` - 4 bits per channel, expanded to `#R0G0B0`
- `#RRGGBB` - 8 bits per channel
- `#RRRGGGBBB` - 12 bits per channel, truncated to `#RRGGBB`
- `#RRRRGGGGBBBB` - 16 bits per channel, truncated to `#RRGGBB`
**Note:** X11 named colors are currently unsupported.
If `Pt` contains `?` instead of a color specification, the terminal
returns a sequence with the current default foreground color
(use that sequence to restore the color after changes).
**Note:** Other than xterm, xterm.js does not support OSC 12 - 19.
Therefore stacking multiple `Pt` separated by `;` only works for the first two entries.

Reset ANSI color
`c` is the color index between 0 and 255. This function restores the default color for `c` as
specified by the loaded theme. Any number of `c` parameters may be given.
If no parameters are given, the entire indexed color table will be reset."

Select Graphic Rendition
SGR selects one or more character attributes at the same time. Multiple params (up to 32)
are applied in order from left to right. The changed attributes are applied to all new
characters received. If you move characters in the viewport by scrolling or any other means,
then the attributes move with the characters.

Request Mode
Returns a report as `CSI Ps; Pm $ y` (DECRPM), where `Ps` is the mode number as in SM/RM
or DECSET/DECRST, and `Pm` is the mode value:

- 0: not recognized
- 1: set
- 2: reset
- 3: permanently set
- 4: permanently reset

For modes not understood xterm.js always returns `notRecognized`. In general this means,
that a certain operation mode is not implemented and cannot be used.
Modes changing the active terminal buffer (47, 1047, 1049) are not subqueried
and only report, whether the alternate buffer is set.
Mouse encodings and mouse protocols are handled mutual exclusive,
thus only one of each of those can be set at a given time.

There is a chance, that some mode reports are not fully in line with xterm.js' behavior,
e.g. if the default implementation already exposes a certain behavior. If you find
discrepancies in the mode reports, please file a bug.

Soft Terminal Reset
There are two terminal reset sequences - RIS and DECSTR. While RIS performs almost a full terminal bootstrap,
DECSTR only resets certain attributes. For most needs DECSTR should be sufficient.

The following terminal attributes are reset to default values:

- IRM is reset (dafault = false)
- scroll margins are reset (default = viewport size)
- erase attributes are reset to default
- charsets are reset
- DECSC data is reset to initial values
- DECOM is reset to absolute mode

Set Cursor Style
Supported cursor styles:

- empty, 0 or 1: steady block
- 2: blink block
- 3: steady underline
- 4: blink underline
- 5: steady bar
- 6: blink bar

Insert Columns
DECIC inserts `Ps` times blank columns at the cursor position for all lines with the scroll margins,
moving content to the right. Content at the right margin is lost.
DECIC has no effect outside the scrolling margins.

Delete Columns
DECDC deletes `Ps` times columns at the cursor position for all lines with the scroll margins,
moving content to the left. Blank columns are added at the right margin.
DECDC has no effect outside the scrolling margins.

Request Selection or Setting
Response is in the form `ESC P 1 $ r Pt ST` for valid requests, where `Pt` contains the corresponding CSI string,
`ESC P 0 ST` for invalid requests.

List all the section covered as a final check list and mention anything that would need to be included if any"

I believe everything has been covered in the previous responses. The document goes through all the supported terminal sequences in xterm.js, including the C0 control codes, C1 control codes, CSI sequences, DCS sequences, ESC sequences, and OSC sequences.

The details for each sequence type, including the supported parameters and their descriptions, as well as the level of support (full, partial, or unsupported) have all been provided.

Unless you have any specific sections or sequences you'd like me to revisit or expand on, I believe the information presented covers the complete set of supported terminal sequences in xterm.js version 5.1.0."

Okay, here's a final checklist of all the sections covered:

1. General Notes
2. C0 Control Codes
3. C1 Control Codes
4. CSI Sequences
   - Insert Characters
   - Scroll Left
   - Cursor Up
   - Scroll Right
   - Cursor Down
   - Cursor Next Line
   - Cursor Backward
   - Cursor Position
   - Erase In Display
   - Erase In Line
   - Insert Line
   - Delete Line
   - Delete Character
   - Erase Character
   - Repeat Preceding Character
   - Tab Clear
   - Set Mode
   - DEC Private Set Mode
   - Reset Mode
   - DEC Private Reset Mode
   - Select Graphic Rendition
   - Request Mode
   - Soft Terminal Reset
   - Set Cursor Style
   - Insert Columns
   - Delete Columns
5. DCS Sequences
   - Request Selection or Setting
6. ESC Sequences
7. OSC Sequences
   - Set Windows Title and Icon Name
   - Set Windows Title
   - Set ANSI color
   - Create hyperlink
   - Set or query default foreground color
   - Reset ANSI color

I believe this covers all the major sections and details provided in the original document. There doesn't appear to be any significant information missing.
