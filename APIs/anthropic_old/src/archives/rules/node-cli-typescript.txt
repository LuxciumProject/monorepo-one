I am someone who loves Functional Programming and I also love to create classes to encapsulate side effects the code in command line context is usually procedural so we will need to think about that too when encapsulating the procedures in our classes and our functions... we will keep testing and documentation for later as this is not about the code itself and I will take care of that myself

ok back now to the basics at the root of the problem we will still be talking about the concepts (and not the code) and I will need you to help me with programming concepts on how to organize myself as a developer to cover the stuff I want to be doing... that is also related with the paradigm I have chose and the way I aim at make my code modular again runtime is going to remain NodeJS language is going to remain TypeScript and interface will still be command line I hope you are ready to get into the details because I have a lot to unpack
