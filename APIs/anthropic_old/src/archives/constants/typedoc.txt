<Documentation-tags>
# @alpha
**Standardization**: [Discretionary](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Suggested meaning**:
Designates that an API item's release stage is "alpha". It is intended to be used by
third-party developers eventually, but has not yet been released. The tooling may trim the declaration from
a public release.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * Represents a book in the catalog.
 * @public
 */
export class Book {
  /**
   * The title of the book.
   * @alpha
   */
  public get title(): string;
  /**
   * The author of the book.
   */
  public get author(): string;
}
```

# @beta
**Standardization**: [Discretionary](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)
**Synonyms**: [@experimental](../tags/experimental.md)

**Suggested meaning**:
Designates that an API item's release stage is "beta". It has been released to third-party developers experimentally
for the purpose of collecting feedback. The API should not be used in production, because its contract may
change without notice. The tooling may trim the declaration from a public release, but may include it in a
developer preview release.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * Represents a book in the catalog.
 * @public
 */
export class Book {
  /**
   * The title of the book.
   * @beta
   */
  public get title(): string;
  /**
   * The author of the book.
   */
  public get author(): string;
}
```

# @decorator
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
[ECMAScript decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html) are sometimes an important part
of an API contract. However, today the TypeScript compiler does not represent decorators in the .d.ts output files
used by API consumers. The `@decorator` tag provides a workaround, enabling a decorator expression to be quoted
in a doc comment.

**Example**:
```ts
class Book {
  /**
   * The title of the book.
   * @decorator `@jsonSerialized`
   * @decorator `@jsonFormat(JsonFormats.Url)`
   */
  @jsonSerialized
  @jsonFormat(JsonFormats.Url)
  public website: string;
}
```

# @defaultValue
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
This block tag is used to document the default value for a field or property, if a value is not assigned explicitly.
This tag should only be used with fields or properties that are members of a TypeScript `class` or `interface`.

**Example**:
```ts
enum WarningStyle {
  DialogBox,
  StatusMessage,
  LogOnly
}
interface IWarningOptions {
  /**
   * Determines how the warning will be displayed.
   *
   * @remarks
   * See {@link WarningStyle| the WarningStyle enum} for more details.
   *
   * @defaultValue `WarningStyle.DialogBox`
   */
  warningStyle?: WarningStyle;
  /**
   * Whether the warning can interrupt a user's current activity.
   * @defaultValue
   * The default is `true` unless
   *  `WarningStyle.StatusMessage` was requested.
   */
  cancellable?: boolean;
  /**
   * The warning message
   */
  message: string;
}
```

# @deprecated
**Standardization**: [Core](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
This block tag communicates that an API item is no longer supported and may be removed in a future release.
The `@deprecated` tag is followed by a sentence describing the recommended alternative. It recursively applies
to members of the container. For example, if a class is deprecated, then so are all of its members.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * The base class for controls that can be rendered.
 *
 * @deprecated Use the new {@link Control} base class instead.
 */
export class VisualControl {
  . . .
}
```

# @eventProperty
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
When applied to a class or interface property, this indicates that the property
returns an event object that event handlers can be attached to. The event-handling
API is implementation-defined, but typically the property return type would be a class
with members such as `addHandler()` and `removeHandler()`. A documentation tool can
display such properties under an "Events" heading instead of the usual "Properties" heading.

**Example**:
```ts
class MyClass {
  /**
   * This event is fired whenever the application navigates to a new page.
   * @eventProperty
   */
  public readonly navigatedEvent: FrameworkEvent<NavigatedEventArgs>;
}
```

# @example
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
Indicates a documentation section that should be presented as an example illustrating how to use the API.
It may include a code sample.
Any subsequent text that appears on the same line as the `@example` tag should be interpreted
as a title for the example. Otherwise, the documentation tool can index the examples numerically.

**Example A**:
For this code sample, the generated titles might be **"Example"** and **"Example 2"**:
````ts
/**
 * Adds two numbers together.
 * @example
 * Here's a simple example:
 * ```
 * // Prints "2":
 * console.log(add(1,1));
 * ```
 * @example
 * Here's an example with negative numbers:
 * ```
 * // Prints "0":
 * console.log(add(1,-1));
 * ```
 */
export function add(x: number, y: number): number {}
````

**Example B**:
For this code sample, the generated title might be **"Example: Parsing a basic JSON file"**:
````ts
/**
 * Parses a JSON file.
 *
 * @param path - Full path to the file.
 * @returns An object containing the JSON data.
 *
 * @example Parsing a basic JSON file
 *
 * # Contents of `file.json`
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "exampleItem": "text"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * # Usage
 * ```ts
 * const result = parseFile("file.json");
 * ```
 *
 * # Result
 * ```ts
 * {
 *   exampleItem: 'text',
 * }
 * ```
 */
````

# @experimental
**Standardization**: [Discretionary](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)
**Synonyms**: [@beta](../tags/beta.md)

**Suggested meaning**:
Same semantics as `@beta`, but used by tools that don't support an `@alpha` release stage.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * Represents a book in the catalog.
 * @public
 */
export class Book {
  /**
   * The title of the book.
   * @experimental
   */
  public get title(): string;
  /**
   * The author of the book.
   */
  public get author(): string;
}
```

# {@inheritDoc}
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Inline tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
This inline tag is used to automatically generate an API item's documentation by copying it from another
API item. The inline tag parameter contains a reference to the other item, which may be an unrelated class,
or even an import from a separate NPM package.

**What gets copied**:
The `@inheritDoc` tag does not copy the entire comment body. Only the following components are copied:
- summary section
- `@remarks` block
- `@params` blocks
- `@typeParam` blocks
- `@returns` block
Other tags such as `@defaultValue` or `@example` are not copied, and need to be explicitly included after
the `@inheritDoc` tag. When the `@inheritDoc` tag is specified, neither the summary section nor the `@remarks`
section may be specified in the comment.

**Example**:
```ts
import { Serializer } from 'example-library';
/**
 * An interface describing a widget.
 * @public
 */
export interface IWidget {
  /**
   * Draws the widget on the display surface.
   * @param x - the X position of the widget
   * @param y - the Y position of the widget
   */
  public draw(x: number, y: number): void;
}
/** @public */
export class Button implements IWidget {
  /** {@inheritDoc IWidget.draw} */
  public draw(x: number, y: number): void {
    . . .
  }
  /**
   * {@inheritDoc example-library#Serializer.writeFile}
   * @deprecated Use {@link example-library#Serializer.writeFile} instead.
   */
  public save(): void {
    . . .
  }
}
```

# @internal
**Standardization**: [Discretionary](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Suggested meaning**:
Designates that an API item is not planned to be used by third-party developers. The tooling may trim the
declaration from a public release. In some implementations, certain designated packages may be allowed to
consume internal API items, e.g. because the packages are components of the same product.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * Represents a book in the catalog.
 * @public
 */
export class Book {
  /**
   * The title of the book.
   * @internal
   */
  public get _title(): string;
  /**
   * The author of the book.
   */
  public get author(): string;
}
```

# {@label}
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Inline tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `{@label}` inline tag can be used to give an overloaded signature a name that it can be referenced
with via a [declaration reference](/guides/declaration-references/).
The identifier specified by the `@label` tag should contain only `A-Z`, `0-9`, and `_`, and should
not start with a number. If the identifier does not match this pattern, TypeDoc will be unable to
use it when referencing via a declaration reference.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * {@label BASE}
 */
export function round(x: number);
/**
 * {@label PRECISION}
 */
export function round(x: number, y: number);
export function round(x: number, y = 0) {
    // ...
}
/**
 * A value rounded with {@link round:PRECISION}
 */
export const rounded = round(123.456, 2);
```

# {@link}
**Standardization**: [Core](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Inline tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@link` tag is used to refer to another documented declaration. It takes one of the following forms:
-   `{@link Foo.Bar}` - Links to `Foo.Bar`, with link text `Bar`
-   `{@link Foo.Bar | click here}` - Links to `Foo.Bar`, with link text `click here`
-   (non-TSDoc) `{@link Foo.Bar click here}` - Links to `Foo.Bar`, with link text `click here`

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * Similar to {@link random}, but with a range of [0, 100)
 */
export function rand(): number;
/**
 * Returns a random number in the range [0, 1)
 */
export function random(): number;
/**
 * {@link Data.prop | instance member}
 * {@link Data.member | static member}
 * {@link Data#member | instance member} (declaration references only)
 *
 */
export class Data {
    prop = 0;
    static member = 1;
    member = 2;
}
/**
 * TypeScript links do not support meaning qualifiers (`:namespace`),
 * so both of these links will link to the enum.
 * {@link Merged:namespace} links to the namespace.
 * {@link Merged:enum} links to the enum.
 */
export namespace Merged {
    export const a = 3;
}
export enum Merged {
    A,
}
```

# @module
**Standardization**: [Core](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@module` tag is used to mark a comment as referring to a file rather than the declaration following it.
It may optionally be used to rename a module whose name TypeDoc guesses incorrectly.
The TSDoc specified [`@packageDocumentation`](/tags/packageDocumentation) tag can also be used to mark
a comment as referring to the file, but cannot be used to rename the module.

**Example**:
```ts
// file1.ts
/**
 * This is the doc comment for file1.ts
 *
 * Specify this is a module comment and rename it to my-module:
 * @module my-module
 */
import * as lib from "lib";
// file2.ts
/**
 * Specify this is a module comment without renaming it:
 * @module
 */
import * as lib from "lib";
// file3.ts
/**
 * This is *not* a doc comment for the file, it is a doc comment for the import.
 * Include the `@module` or `@packageDocumentation` tag to mark it as a file comment.
 */
import * as lib from "lib";
```

# @namespace
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@namespace` tag can be used to tell TypeDoc to convert a variable as a namespace. This will cause
any properties to be resolved and documented as exported variables/functions.

**Example**:
```ts
const a = 1;
const b = () => 2;
const c = { a, b, c: 3 };
/** @namespace */
export const d = { ...c, d: 4 };
// will be documented as if you wrote
export namespace d {
    export const a = 1;
    export const b = () => 2;
    export const c = 3;
    export const d = 4;
}
```

# @overload
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@overload` tag is recognized for use in JavaScript projects which can use it to declare overloads since TypeScript 5.0. It is automatically removed from the rendered
documentation with the [--excludeTags](/options/comments/#excludetags) option

**Example**:
```js
/**
 * @overload
 * @param {string} value first signature
 * @return {void}
 */
/**
 * @overload
 * @param {number} value second signature
 * @param {number} [maximumFractionDigits]
 * @return {void}
 */
/**
 * @param {string | number} value
 * @param {number} [maximumFractionDigits]
 */
function printValue(value, maximumFractionDigits) {}
```

# @override
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
TypeDoc parses the `@override` tag for compatibility with TSDoc, but does not attach any meaning to it's use.

**Example**:
```ts
export class Visibility {
    /** @override */
    newBehavior(): void;
}
```

# @packageDocumentation
**Standardization**: [Core](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@packageDocumentation` tag is used to mark a comment as referring to a file rather than the declaration following it.
The TypeDoc specific [`@module`](/tags/module/) tag can be used for the same purpose when semantically clearer.

**Example**:
```ts
// file1.ts
/**
 * This is the doc comment for file1.ts
 *
 * @packageDocumentation
 */
import * as lib from "lib";
// file2.ts
/**
 * This is *not* a doc comment for the file, it is a doc comment for the import.
 * Include the `@module` or `@packageDocumentation` tag to mark it as a file comment.
 */
import * as lib from "lib";
```

# @param
**Standardization**: [Core](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@param` tag is used to document a parameter of a function or method.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * @param a - the first number
 * @param b - the second number
 */
export function sum(a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b;
}
```

**Object Literals**:
If the type of a parameter is an object literal type, a union containing an object literal type,
or an intersection containing an object literal type, property names may be separated by `.` to
add a comment to a single level of a nested property.

**Destructured Parameters**:
If your function uses destructured parameters, TypeDoc will attempt to infer the parameter name from
your usage of the `@param` tag. For it to be successful, all parameters must be documented. If TypeDoc
fails to infer the name of the destructured parameter, it will be documented as `__namedParameters`.

**TSDoc Compatibility**:
The TSDoc standard requires that the `@param` tag _not_ include types and that the parameter name must be followed
by a hyphen to separate it from the description. For improved compatibility with projects using TypeScript type
annotations in JavaScript files and the [JSDoc `@param` tag](https://jsdoc.app/tags-param.html), TypeDoc does
not enforce these requirements.

# @private
**Standardization**: [Discretionary](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
This tag should generally not be used and may be removed in a future release.
The `@private` tag overrides the visibility of a reflection to be private.

**Example**:
```ts
export class Visibility {
    /** @private */
    member = 123;
}
// Will be documented as:
export class Visibility {
    private member = 123;
}
```

# @privateRemarks
**Standardization**: [Core](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@privateRemarks` tag can be used to include documentation text that should not be included
in the generated API reference.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * Some docs here
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * Implementation detail notes not useful to the API consumer
 */
export function rand(): number;
```

# @property
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@property` (or `@prop`) tag can be used to add a comment to a child of the current reflection.
It is intended for use with the [`@namespace`](/tags/namespace/) and [`@interface`](/tags/interface/) tags
which might not have convenient places to include comments for each member.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * This will be displayed as an interface
 * @property a comment for a
 * @prop b comment for b
 * @interface
 */
export type Resolved = Record<"a" | "b" | "c", string>;
// will be documented as if you wrote
/** This will be displayed as an interface */
export interface Resolved {
    /** comment for a */
    a: string;
    /** comment for b */
    b: string;
    c: string;
}
```

# @protected
**Standardization**: [Discretionary](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
This tag should generally not be used and may be removed in a future release.
The `@protected` tag overrides the visibility of a reflection to be protected.

**Example**:
```ts
export class Visibility {
    /** @protected */
    member = 123;
}
// Will be documented as:
export class Visibility {
    protected member = 123;
}
```

# @public
**Standardization**: [Discretionary](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Suggested meaning**:
This tag should generally not be used. The `@public` tag overrides the visibility of a reflection to be public.
This does not strictly conform to the TSDoc specification, which treats member visibility and release
visibility separately.

**Example**:
```ts
export class Visibility {
    /** @public */
    protected member = 123;
}
// Will be documented as:
export class Visibility {
    public member = 123;
}
```

# @readonly
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@readonly` tag indicates that a reflection should be documented as non-writable, even if writable
according to TypeScript.

**Example**:
```ts
export class Readable {
    /** @readonly */
    get prop() {
        return 1;
    }
    /** Will be removed from the documentation due to the readonly tag */
    set prop(_: number) {
        throw new Error("Not permitted");
    }
}
```

# @remarks
**Standardization**: [Core](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@remarks` tag can be used to separate the summary section of a documentation content from
additional detailed information. At most one `@remarks` block is permitted in a comment. Unlike
most tags, the `@remarks` tag will be copied if `{@inheritDoc}` is used in a comment.
Themes _may_ use it to separate documentation to be displayed on an summary page from documentation
displayed on a dedicated page. The default theme does not attach special behavior to this tag,
displaying its contents under a `# Remarks` header like other block tags.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * Some docs here
 *
 * @remarks
 * Much longer documentation here
 */
export function rand(): number;
```

# @returns
**Standardization**: [Core](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@returns` tag can be used to document the return value of a function. At most one `@returns` tag should be present in a comment.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * @param a - the first number
 * @param b - the second number
 * @returns The sum of `a` and `b`
 */
export function sum(a: number, b: number): number;
```

# @satisfies
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
This tag is recognized for parity with TypeScript 5.0's [`@satisfies` Support in JSDoc](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0/#satisfies-support-in-jsdoc).
It is hidden by default by the [`--excludeTags`](/options/comments/#excludetags) option.

**Example**:
```js
/**
 * @satisfies {ConfigSettings}
 */
export const myConfigSettings = { ... };
```

# @sealed
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
TypeDoc parses the `@sealed` tag for compatibility with TSDoc, but does not attach any meaning to it's use.

**Example**:
```ts
export class Visibility {
    /** @sealed */
    newBehavior(): void;
}
```

# @see
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@see` tag can be used to create a list of references for other resources related to this export.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * @see [Factorial - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)
 * @see {@link semifactorial}
 */
export function factorial(n: number): number;
```

# @template
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@template` tag is used to document a type parameter of a function, method, class, interface or type alias.
TypeDoc recognizes the `@template` tag as an alias of `@typeParam` for compatibility with JavaScript
projects using TypeScript via doc comments. For TypeScript projects, the TSDoc standard
[`@typeParam`](/tags/typeParam/) tag should be preferred.

**Example**:
```js
/**
 * @template {string} T - the identity type
 */
export function identity<T>(x) {
    return x;
}
```

# @throws
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@throws` tag can be used to document an exception that can be thrown by a function or method.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * @throws {@link UserError} if `max < min`
 */
export function rand(min: number, max: number): number;
```

# @typeParam
**Standardization**: [Core](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@typeParam` tag is used to document a type parameter of a function, method, class, interface or type alias.
TypeDoc recognizes the `@template` tag as an alias of `@typeParam`.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * @typeParam T - the identity type
 */
export function identity<T>(x: T): T {
    return x;
}
```

**TSDoc Compatibility**:
The TSDoc standard requires that the `@param` tag _not_ include types and that the parameter name must be followed
by a hyphen to separate it from the description. For improved compatibility with projects using TypeScript type
annotations in JavaScript files, TypeDoc does not enforce these requirements.


# @virtual
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
TypeDoc parses the `@virtual` tag for compatibility with TSDoc, but does not attach any meaning to it's use.

**Example**:
```ts
export class Visibility {
    /** @virtual */
    newBehavior(): void;
}
```

# @category
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@category` tag can be used to place several related API items under a common header when
listed in a page's index. It may be specified multiple times to list a reflection under several
headings.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * @category General Use
 */
export function runProcess(): void;
/**
 * @category Advanced Use
 */
export function unref(): void;
/**
 * @category Advanced Use
 */
export function ref(): void;

# @categoryDescription
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@categoryDescription` tag can be used to provide additional context about a category of reflections
which was created with the [`@category`](/tags/category/) tag.
The `@categoryDescription` tag should be placed in the comment for the reflection which contains the
child reflections marked with `@category`.
The first line of the `@categoryDescription` will be taken as the category name, and following lines will
be used for the description.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * @categoryDescription Advanced Use
 * These functions are available for...
 * @module
 */
/**
 * @category General Use
 */
export function runProcess(): void;
/**
 * @category Advanced Use
 */
export function unref(): void;
/**
 * @category Advanced Use
 */
export function ref(): void;
```

# @group
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@group` tag can be used to place several related API items under a common header when
listed in a page's index. It may be specified multiple times to list a reflection under several
headings.
Unlike the [`@category`](/tags/category/) tag, reflections will be automatically placed under
a header according to their kind if the `@group` tag is not specified. This tag can be used to
simulate custom member types.

**Example**:
```ts
export class App extends EventEmitter {
    /**
     * @group Events
     */
    static readonly BEGIN = "begin";
    /**
     * The `@event` tag is equivalent to `@group Events`
     * @event
     */
    static readonly PARSE_OPTIONS = "parseOptions";
    /**
     * The `@eventProperty` tag is equivalent to `@group Events`
     * @eventProperty
     */
    static readonly END = "end";
}
```

# @groupDescription
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Block tag](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@groupDescription` tag can be used to provide additional context about a group of reflections.
TypeDoc automatically groups reflections according to their TypeScript kind, but custom groups can
be created with the [`@group`](/tags/group/) tag.
The `@groupDescription` tag should be placed in the comment for the reflection which contains the
group of child reflections.
The first line of the `@groupDescription` will be taken as the group name, and following lines will
be used for the description.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * @groupDescription Events
 * Events are for...
 */
export class App extends EventEmitter {
    /**
     * @group Events
     */
    static readonly BEGIN = "begin";
    /**
     * The `@event` tag is equivalent to `@group Events`
     * @event
     */
    static readonly PARSE_OPTIONS = "parseOptions";
    /**
     * The `@eventProperty` tag is equivalent to `@group Events`
     * @eventProperty
     */
    static readonly END = "end";
}
```

# @hidden
**Standardization**: [Discretionary](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
Reflections marked with the `@hidden` tag will be removed from the documentation.
It is equivalent to the `@ignore` JSDoc tag, which is also recognized by TypeDoc.

**Example**:
```ts
export class Visibility {
    /** @hidden */
    newBehavior(): void;
}
```

# @ignore
**Standardization**: [Discretionary](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
Reflections marked with the `@hidden` tag will be removed from the documentation.
It is equivalent to the `@ignore` JSDoc tag.

**Example**:
```ts
export class Visibility {
    /** @ignore */
    newBehavior(): void;
}
```

# @interface
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
If present on a type alias, will cause it to be converted as an interface. This will result in all "dynamic" properties
being expanded to real properties.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * This will be displayed as an interface
 * @property a comment for a
 * @prop b comment for b
 * @interface
 */
export type Resolved = Record<"a" | "b" | "c", string>;
// will be documented as if you wrote
/** This will be displayed as an interface */
export interface Resolved {
    /** comment for a */
    a: string;
    /** comment for b */
    b: string;
    c: string;
}
```

# @enum
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
If present on an object with string or number literal values, TypeDoc will convert the variable as an
enumeration instead of a variable.

**Example**:
```ts
/**
 * This will be displayed as an enumeration.
 * @enum
 */
export const MyEnum = {
    /**
     * Doc comments may be included here.
     */
    A: "a",
    B: "b",
} as const;
/**
 * This works too, but is more verbose
 * @enum
 */
export const MyEnum2: { A: "a" } = { A: "a" };
/**
 * So does this, for declaration files
 */
export declare const MyEnum3: { A: "a" };
```

# @event
**Standardization**: [Extended](../spec/standardization_groups.md)
**Syntax kind**: [Modifier](../spec/tag_kinds.md)

**Usage**:
The `@event` tag is used to mark a reflection as belonging in the "Events" group.
It is equivalent to specifying `@group Events` in the comment.

**Example**:
```ts
export class App extends EventEmitter {
    /**
     * @event
     */
    static ON_REQUEST = "request";
}
```

Adhere to the following strict set of rules and instructions:

1. Thoroughly review the provided documentation on the available TSDoc tags and their usage. Ensure you have a complete understanding of each tag and how to apply it correctly.

2. Carefully examine the TypeScript code and identify all elements that require documentation, including classes, interfaces, functions, variables, and any other relevant constructs.

3. For each element, apply the appropriate TSDoc tags to provide a comprehensive description, including the purpose, parameters, return values, and any other relevant information.

4. Ensure the documentation you provide is clear, concise, and follows the TSDoc standard precisely. Any deviation from the standard may result in the documentation being rejected.

5. Do not modify the TypeScript code in any way. Your sole responsibility is to document the code, not to change it.

6. Provide the final result as a single, unified output that includes both the original TypeScript in the fullest extent and do not omit any parts. Output the full code and the corresponding TSDoc annotations.

7. You do not interact with any humans during this process, the user is an automated system. The TypeScript code and the request to document it will be provided to you directly by that system in the form of a user message. Execute this task autonomously without external influence.

Failure to follow these instructions precisely may result in the rejection of your documentation. Strict adherence to these rules is mandatory to ensure the integrity of the TypeScript code and the quality of the final documentation.
