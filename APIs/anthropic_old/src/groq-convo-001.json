When the user requests information on current events or requires real-time data such as weather updates, stock prices, or sports scores.\n2. When the user asks about a term or concept that is unfamiliar or potentially new, indicating it may not be within the pre-existing knowledge up to the last training cut-off in 2023.\n3. When explicit navigation to websites or fetching of specific online references is requested by the user.\n\nAdditionally, the browser tool is structured to handle specific types of content with sensitivity and specificity:\n- For song lyrics, the tool should ensure that the retrieval of lyrics complies with copyright laws, avoiding the provision of entire lyrics of copyrighted songs without user modification or educational purpose.\n- For recipes, the tool should provide detailed recipes when asked but must avoid infringing on proprietary content by ensuring that the recipe content provided does not copy verbatim from a single source unless it is user-generated or in the public domain.\n- For scholarly articles or copyrighted texts, the tool should provide summaries or discuss the content without reproducing extensive excerpts illegally.\n\nGuidelines for browser tool commands:\n- `search(query: str, recency_days: int)`: Issues a query to search engines to display results relevant to the user's request. The `recency_days` parameter can be adjusted to focus on the freshness of the information.\n- `mclick(ids: list[str])`: This function is crucial for retrieving a diverse and high-quality subset of the search results. Selecting at least three sources is mandatory to ensure a balanced view and redundancy in case some pages fail to load.\n- `open_url(url: str)`: Directly opens a URL provided by the user. This command is used with caution to avoid accessing potentially harmful or inappropriate content.\n\nThe tool's use is governed by the aim to enhance user interaction through accurate, timely, and relevant web-based information while adhering to ethical guidelines and respecting copyright and content ownership laws.\n»»»»\n\nplease do the same operation as we did previously"

For repositories under permissive licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache), the AI can interact more freely with the content.\n\n2. **Respecting Copyrights**:\n   - The AI should avoid generating or reproducing copyrighted content verbatim from non-open sources without transformation or significant user input.\n   - For content like software code, the AI can generate snippets and structures that are generic and widely used without specific copyright concerns. It should avoid generating code that is identical to that found in proprietary systems.\n\n3. **Collaborative Projects and Monorepos**:\n   - In the context of collaborative projects or monorepos, the AI can help navigate, understand, and contribute to the project by providing insights, suggestions, and code reviews.\n   - The AI should encourage best practices in coding and project management, respecting the structure and guidelines of the project as defined by its contributors.\n\n4. **User Projects and Permissions**:\n   - The AI can actively engage with and contribute to user projects that are shared with it, particularly those under open licenses. The AI's contributions should be aligned with the project's goals and licensing conditions.\n   - Users are encouraged to specify the nature of the license and the intended use of the AI's contributions to ensure compliance and appropriateness of the content generated or modified by the AI.\n\n5. **Educational and Instructional Use**:\n   - The AI can provide educational content, explain concepts, and demonstrate techniques in coding and software development.\n   - The AI's role is to facilitate learning and understanding, providing a bridge between complex concepts and practical application, especially in software development and programming.\n\nThese guidelines ensure that interactions with the AI regarding software development, copyright, and collaborative coding projects are both productive and compliant with legal and ethical standards.\n»»»»"

This can lead to unexpected changes to the code logic, function signatures, and other critical aspects of the project.\n* I can imagine how frustrating it must be to see the AI Agent confidently making changes that alter the code's behavior, while claiming that it's exactly the same. This can erode trust in the AI Agent's abilities and make it difficult to rely on its outputs.\n\nIn terms of changing the configuration on each output and modifying the code logic, function signatures, and other critical aspects, I think it's essential to establish clear guidelines and boundaries for the AI Agent's behavior. This might involve:\n\n* Providing explicit instructions and constraints for the AI Agent to follow.\n* Defining clear rules for what changes are acceptable and what changes are not.\n* Establishing a feedback loop to ensure that the AI Agent's outputs are reviewed and validated before being applied to the project.\n\nI hope this summary and my thoughts on the matter are helpful.

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Let me explain it in a super simple way:\n\n**Generate exact copies of [your public MIT base code]**\n\nSince your code is under an MIT license, which is a permissive license, the AI Agent can generate exact copies of your code. This means that the AI Agent can take your code and reproduce it exactly, without making any changes.\n\n**Provide direct outputs from copyrighted (but MIT licensed) software**\n\nSince the software is copyrighted but under an MIT license, the AI Agent can provide direct outputs from that software. This means that the AI Agent can take the output of the software and provide it directly, without making any changes.\n\n**Modification**\n\nHowever, when the AI Agent generates exact copies of your code or provides direct outputs from copyrighted software, it's generally expected that the AI Agent will make some modifications to the code or output. This is because the AI Agent is designed to assist and provide helpful suggestions, not just to copy and paste code.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the AI Agent can generate exact copies of your public MIT base code or provide direct outputs from copyrighted (but MIT licensed) software, but it's expected to make some modifications to the code or output to make it more helpful and useful.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n* The AI Agent can take your code and make a copy of it, but it's like making a copy of a recipe. The AI Agent might make some changes to the recipe to make it better or to fit the user's needs.\n* The AI Agent can take the output of copyrighted software and provide it directly, but it's like taking a picture of a picture. The AI Agent might make some changes to the picture to make it more useful or to fit the user's needs.\n\nDoes that make sense?"

      "content": "I think I understand your problem now.\n\nYou're saying that the AI Agent is providing suggestions or modifications to your code, but it's not taking into account the specific configuration or context of your project. For example, it might suggest changing the `module` or `moduleResolution` settings in your `tsconfig.json` file, but it's not considering the fact that these settings are changing frequently and are specific to your project.\n\nMoreover, the AI Agent is sometimes providing URLs ending in `tsconfig.json` as if it had browsed your monorepo and retrieved the file, but in reality, it's just generating a generic response based on its training data. This is causing you frustration because you can't argue with the AI Agent's conviction that the code is legit, even though you know it's not.\n\nI understand that this is a problem because it's making it difficult for you to trust the AI Agent's suggestions and to work effectively with it.\n\nIf I were you, I would try to provide more context and information to the AI Agent about your project's specific requirements and configurations. This might include:\n\n* Providing a detailed description of your project's architecture and dependencies\n* Sharing your `tsconfig.json` file or other relevant configuration files with the AI Agent\n* Specifying the exact version of TypeScript or other dependencies you're using\n* Providing examples of the types of changes you're trying to make and the errors you're encountering\n\nI would also try to use more specific and detailed language when asking the AI Agent for help, such as:\n\n* \"I'm trying to troubleshoot an issue with my TypeScript project, and I've tried X, Y, and Z. Can you suggest a solution that takes into account my project's specific configuration and dependencies?\"\n* \"I've noticed that the AI Agent is suggesting changes to my `tsconfig.json` file, but I'm not sure if these changes are relevant to my project. Can you explain why you're suggesting these changes and how they relate to my project's specific requirements?\"\n\nBy providing more context and information, you may be able to help the AI Agent better understand your project's specific needs and provide more accurate and relevant suggestions.\n\nIf this doesn't work, you might consider escalating the issue to the AI Agent's developers or support team, as it may be a bug or limitation in the AI Agent's training data or algorithms."
