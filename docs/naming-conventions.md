# Naming Conventions

This document outlines the naming conventions to be followed for files, folders, and variables in the `monorepo-one` project. Consistent naming conventions help improve readability, maintainability, and collaboration within the project.

## File Naming Conventions

- Use `kebab-case` for filenames.
  - Example: `user-profile.ts`
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the file.
  - Example: `user-service.ts` instead of `service.ts`

## Folder Naming Conventions

- Use `kebab-case` for folder names.
  - Example: `user-services`
- Group related files into folders based on their functionality or domain.
  - Example: `services/user-services`

## Variable Naming Conventions

- Use `camelCase` for variable names.
  - Example: `userName`, `totalPrice`
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the variable.
  - Example: `userAge` instead of `age`

## Class Naming Conventions

- Use `PascalCase` for class names.
  - Example: `UserProfile`, `ShoppingCart`
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the class.
  - Example: `OrderService` instead of `Service`

## Constant Naming Conventions

- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants.
  - Example: `MAX_USERS`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the constant.
  - Example: `MAX_RETRIES` instead of `RETRIES`

## Function Naming Conventions

- Use `camelCase` for function names.
  - Example: `calculateTotal`, `getUserById`
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the function.
  - Example: `fetchUserData` instead of `fetchData`

## Interface and Type Naming Conventions

- Use `PascalCase` for interfaces and type definitions.
  - Example: `UserProfile`, `OrderDetails`
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the interface or type.
  - Example: `UserAddress` instead of `Address`

## Additional Guidelines

- Avoid abbreviations and acronyms unless they are well-known and widely accepted.
  - Example: `HTMLParser` instead of `HP`
- Be consistent with naming conventions throughout the project.
- Regularly review and update naming conventions as the project evolves.

By following these naming conventions, we can ensure that our codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable. Consistent naming conventions also facilitate collaboration and make it easier for new team members to understand the code.
