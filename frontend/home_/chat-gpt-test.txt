I don’t know if your internal policy has changed but it seems like it is easier to let you find it rather than pass the link because you have hidden policies and they must be different from one an other because you have quite different behaviours finding the same thing yourself vs a link which also are both different from  uploading the file itself and copy pasting the code in the chat or providing a screenshot of the same code… but given that you don’t know it seems it must be some hidden policy or whatever
