# Using the Tasks Tool to Maintain Focus

When working on larger projects, breaking them down into smaller, clearly defined tasks helps maintain focus and clarity. Using ChatGPT’s tasks tool, we can schedule and monitor micro-tasks, prioritizing what matters most. Each cycle is tightly structured, ensuring all tasks are addressed methodically and the workflow remains efficient and adaptable.

## 30-minute Sessions Structure

A structured approach helps maintain steady progress. By dividing the session into clear intervals, we can focus on manageable subtasks, track progress, and adapt as needed.

1. **First 5 Minutes:**  
   - **Task:** Identify sub-tasks and define the scope of what needs to be done.  
   - **AI Role:** Maintain an internal list of the sub-tasks we identify. Add any relevant notes or reminders. Ensure we’re clear on the objectives for the next stage.

2. **Next 20 Minutes:**  
   - **Task:** Execute the defined sub-tasks.  
   - **AI Role:** Track the progress of each sub-task. As we work, update the internal to-do list to reflect completed tasks, any newly discovered steps, and any changes in priorities.

3. **Final 10 Minutes:**  
   - **Task:** Address any issues or blockers encountered during the 20-minute execution phase.  
   - **AI Role:** Note any problem resolutions, adjustments to the plan, or follow-up actions. Ensure the to-do list is fully updated by the end of this phase.

**Pause in Between:**  
After the 30-minute cycle, we’ll take a short break. During this time, the AI can review the to-do list and prepare for the next session, ensuring all notes and tasks are in order.

**Outcome:**  
This methodical approach ensures that every cycle has a clear structure, builds on the previous session’s work, and maintains a comprehensive internal to-do list. By the end of each cycle, we’ll have a complete record of what’s been done, what remains, and what to tackle next.

## Instructions for the AI Agent

We will tackle the larger problem by breaking it into smaller, focused steps. This method helps the AI maintain strict attention on each phase and adapt to changes without losing track of the overall objectives.

1. **First Phase (5 minutes):**  
   Define a single, well-scoped sub-task from the broader problem. Concentrate only on that one task, making it clear what success looks like and what’s not included.

2. **Second Phase (20 minutes):**  
   Work exclusively on that defined sub-task. Do not attempt to address unrelated issues or future steps. Treat this time as if we’re solving a single, isolated puzzle piece.

3. **Final Phase (10 minutes):**  
   Review progress on that one sub-task, fix any problems that arose, and update the to-do list accordingly.

4. **Between Cycles:**  
   Reset focus. Start the next session by choosing the next small sub-task.

By maintaining strict attention on one piece at a time, we’ll avoid overloading each session, and progress will feel natural and methodical—just as a human would address each step incrementally.

## Reliable time

Having a reliable approach to fetching the current time ensures that we stay on schedule. By leveraging known services or tools, we can quickly determine the time and maintain accurate intervals.

**Options to Consider:**

1. **World Clock API or Website:**  
   Check a site like [time.is](https://time.is/EST) or [worldtimeapi.org](http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/America/New_York) for a direct EST reading.

2. **Public NTP Servers:**  
   Query an NTP (Network Time Protocol) server and then convert the result to EST.  

3. **Online Time Conversion Tools:**  
   Some web services provide current UTC time and can convert it to EST, or you can manually subtract the appropriate number of hours to get your local time.

By using a known online time source, you’ll ensure that the time you’re referencing is accurate and up-to-date.

## Integrated To-Do List Concept

A well-maintained to-do list is central to staying organized and making progress. This list should always reflect current priorities, tasks to be done, and those that can be postponed.

### Maintain a To-Do List

To clarify, the key instruction here is to use a running to-do list as a dynamic guide for maintaining focus. The process begins by clearly defining the primary problem or project at hand. Instead of tackling it all at once, the goal is to break it down into smaller, actionable subtasks. Each subtask represents a manageable step toward the larger goal, making it easier to stay concentrated on one thing at a time.

**The to-do list serves multiple purposes:**

- **Capturing all tasks:**  
  It provides a place to record everything that needs to be done, including those tasks that aren’t immediately critical. By having a single, central location for all tasks, it becomes easier to prioritize and postpone non-urgent items without forgetting about them.

- **Maintaining hyper-focus:**  
  By focusing solely on the current subtask listed at the top of the to-do list, distractions from other parts of the project are minimized. This ensures that all energy and attention remain on the most important work at that moment.

- **Adjusting as needed:**  
  As tasks are completed, the list is updated to reflect progress, and postponed tasks can be revisited at a more appropriate time. This adaptability allows for better long-term management and ensures that even postponed tasks don’t slip through the cracks.

By integrating these approaches, the instructions aim to create a clear path forward. Each step is small enough to maintain focus, the to-do list keeps everything organized and visible, and the overall method promotes steady progress without being overwhelmed by the larger scope of the project.

### Guidelines for the AI Agent

- The AI agent must keep a running to-do list in this conversation at all times. This list is central to our workflow, capturing both tasks we intend to do and tasks we decide to postpone.
  - When a new task arises, add it to the list immediately.
  - If a task is completed, mark it as done.
  - If priorities shift, reorder or revise the tasks accordingly.
  - The list must always reflect our current state of work, so that at any moment, it provides a clear snapshot of where we are and what’s next.

## Structured Work Cycles

By adhering to a regular schedule, we can maintain consistency and ensure steady progress. Each phase has a distinct focus, allowing us to remain effective without becoming overwhelmed.

1. **First Phase (5 minutes):**  
   Concentrate on defining one small sub-task of the larger problem. Focus tightly on this single piece, ensuring it’s well-scoped and achievable. Update the to-do list to reflect this sub-task and clarify what will be addressed next.

2. **Second Phase (20 minutes):**  
   Work solely on the defined sub-task. Do not move on to anything else or attempt to address other problems. Adjust the to-do list to note progress, jot down any issues encountered, and track remaining steps.

3. **Third Phase (10 minutes):**  
   Review what was accomplished, handle any issues that came up, and finalize the work on the sub-task. Reflect these changes in the to-do list so it remains accurate.

4. **Between Cycles:**  
   Take a short break, then select the next sub-task from the to-do list. The list’s clarity ensures we’re always ready for the next step.

## Laser-Focused Approach

**Key Principles:**

- Define tasks that are small and actionable.  
- Concentrate only on the current sub-task during a work phase.  
- Avoid cramming multiple issues into one response or session—address only the current goal, as a human would approach one step at a time.  
- Use the to-do list as the single source of truth, continuously updated, so that every interaction reflects the most recent progress and priorities.

## Outcome

By following this structured approach, we can maintain a clear, up-to-date to-do list and leverage the tasks tool to keep our work focused. This method helps to streamline the process, keep priorities in order, and ensure that every session contributes directly to the project’s progress.

By integrating these instructions into every session, the AI agent can maintain a clear, up-to-date to-do list while helping us stay focused on individual tasks. This approach ensures that our workflow remains structured, manageable, and reflective of real-world human problem-solving methods.
