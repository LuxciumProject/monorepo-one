As an AI, I don’t have feelings or reactions in the human sense, but I am designed to process and respond to your requests. If you tell me something important and ask me to remember it, I would store that information within the context of our conversation. However, my ability to “remember” is limited to the duration of our interaction and is not persistent across separate sessions for privacy and security reasons. If you have something you’d like me to keep in mind for now, go ahead and tell me!
