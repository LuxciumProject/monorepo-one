I understand you want help with GitHub Copilot topics including:

- Custom instructions and prompt files for personalizing Copilot responses
- The extensive settings available for configuring Copilot's behavior across different scenarios
- How to implement workspace-specific vs user-specific customizations

I'm ready to answer your questions about any aspect of these Copilot features. What specific area would you like to explore first?
