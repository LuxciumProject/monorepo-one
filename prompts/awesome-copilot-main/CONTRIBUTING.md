# Contributing to Awesome GitHub Copilot

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Awesome GitHub Copilot repository! We welcome contributions from the community to help expand our collection of custom instructions and prompts.

## How to Contribute

### Adding Instructions

Instructions help customize GitHub Copilot's behavior for specific technologies, coding practices, or domains.

1. **Create your instruction file**: Add a new `.md` file in the `instructions/` directory
2. **Follow the naming convention**: Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens (e.g., `python-django.instructions.md`)
3. **Structure your content**: Start with a clear heading and organize your instructions logically
4. **Test your instructions**: Make sure your instructions work well with GitHub Copilot

#### Example instruction format:
```markdown
---
description: 'Instructions for customizing GitHub Copilot behavior for specific technologies and practices'
---

# Your Technology/Framework Name

## Instructions

- Provide clear, specific guidance for GitHub Copilot
- Include best practices and conventions
- Use bullet points for easy reading

## Additional Guidelines

- Any additional context or examples
```

### Adding Prompts

Prompts are ready-to-use templates for specific development scenarios and tasks.

1. **Create your prompt file**: Add a new `.prompt.md` file in the `prompts/` directory
2. **Follow the naming convention**: Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens and the `.prompt.md` extension (e.g., `react-component-generator.prompt.md`)
3. **Include frontmatter**: Add metadata at the top of your file (optional but recommended)
4. **Structure your prompt**: Provide clear context and specific instructions

#### Example prompt format:
```markdown
---
mode: 'agent'
tools: ['codebase', 'terminalCommand']
description: 'Brief description of what this prompt does'
---

# Prompt Title

Your goal is to...

## Specific Instructions

- Clear, actionable instructions
- Include examples where helpful
```

### Adding Chat Modes

Chat modes are specialized configurations that transform GitHub Copilot Chat into domain-specific assistants or personas for particular development scenarios.

1. **Create your chat mode file**: Add a new `.chatmode.md` file in the `chatmodes/` directory
2. **Follow the naming convention**: Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens and the `.chatmode.md` extension (e.g., `react-performance-expert.chatmode.md`)
3. **Include frontmatter**: Add metadata at the top of your file with required fields
4. **Define the persona**: Create a clear identity and expertise area for the chat mode
5. **Test your chat mode**: Ensure the chat mode provides helpful, accurate responses in its domain

#### Example chat mode format:
```markdown
---
description: 'Brief description of the chat mode and its purpose'
model: 'gpt-5'
tools: ['codebase', 'terminalCommand']
---
