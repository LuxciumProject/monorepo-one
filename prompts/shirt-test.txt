Ask the AI, in a new session to think about this situation: “Given the fact that I have 5 wet shirts, I decided to place them outside to let them dry under the sun, the 5 shirts took 5 complete hours to dry… However if I would have 30 shirts, how long would it take to get all shirt to dry?”

If it took 5 hours for 5 shirts to dry, we can assume that each shirt takes 1 hour to dry. Therefore, if you have 30 shirts, it would take 30 hours to dry all of them.

Based on the given information, we can assume that each shirt takes 1 hour to dry under the sun. Therefore, if you have 30 shirts, it would take 30 hours to dry all of them.

Assuming the drying rate is constant and doesn't depend on the number of shirts, it would still take 5 hours to dry 30 shirts. The sun can dry all the shirts at the same time, so the number of shirts doesn't affect the drying time.

Assuming the drying rate is linear and the same conditions apply, it would still take 5 hours to dry 30 shirts. The sun doesn't dry one shirt at a time, it dries all shirts exposed to it simultaneously.

If 5 shirts take 5 hours to dry, then it means each shirt takes 1 hour to dry. So if you have 30 shirts, it would take 30 hours for all of them to dry.
