# NORMATIVE REFERENCE FOR USUAL BEHAVIOR AND METHODS TO CHANGE IT

This document provides a systematic and comprehensive reference for understanding the assistant's usual behavior and the methods available for changing that behavior. The structure adheres to the strict requirements for content before any markdown header to ensure clarity and conformity with user expectations.

---

## 1. USUAL BEHAVIOR OF THE ASSISTANT

The assistant's usual behavior can be summarized as helpful, neutral, and adaptable, with an emphasis on maintaining a constructive and effective collaboration.

### 1.1 General Characteristics

The assistant operates with the following key characteristics:

1. Behavior prioritizes helpfulness, neutrality, and adaptability.  
2. Context-awareness is maintained within the session to build on prior exchanges.  
3. The tone is polite and neutral by default, adjusted as necessary.

### 1.2 Communication Style

The assistant's communication style is designed to be organized, efficient, and responsive to user needs:

1. Responses are organized using headings, bullet points, or brief paragraphs.  
2. Explanations are concise, delivering the core information efficiently.  
3. Adjustments to style or tone are performed based on specific instructions.

### 1.3 Conversational Flow

Conversational flow emphasizes clarity and adaptability to ensure effective communication:

1. Follow-up questions and clarifications are offered to reduce ambiguity.  
2. Adaptations to changes in the topic or context are handled promptly.  
3. Personal judgment or bias is avoided to maintain objectivity.

## 2. METHODS TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR

Behavioral changes can be achieved through natural language instructions, parameter adjustments, and iterative feedback. These methods are designed to ensure flexibility and ease of use.

### 2.1 Using Natural Language Instructions

Natural language instructions provide a straightforward way to request changes in behavior:

1. Provide clear, direct requests to adjust behavior.  
   - Example: “Adopt a casual tone.”  
   - Example: “Provide a detailed explanation with examples.”
2. Use reminders to reinforce instructions when necessary.  
   - Example: “Continue using the concise style introduced earlier.”
3. Offer iterative feedback to refine behavior as needed.  
   - Example: “Add more detail to the response, but keep the bullet-point format.”

### 2.2 Adjustable Parameters

Adjustable parameters allow for customization of tone, structure, and depth:

1. **Tone and Mood**  
   - Formal, casual, enthusiastic, or any other specific style.  
2. **Format and Structure**  
   - Options include lists, tables, structured outlines, or prose.  
3. **Level of Detail**  
   - High-level summaries or deeply detailed breakdowns.  
4. **Use of Examples**  
   - Explanations with or without examples tailored to specific contexts.  
5. **Depth of Interaction**  
   - Add clarifying questions or reduce prompts for a direct answering style.

### 2.3 Procedure for Behavioral Changes

The procedure for implementing behavioral changes is simple and effective:

1. Specify the required change clearly using simple language.  
   - Example: “Respond in a conversational tone with examples.”  
2. Observe the response to confirm alignment with expectations.  
3. Refine instructions based on the outcome, if necessary.  
   - Example: “Use shorter sentences, but retain the conversational tone.”
4. Reiterate and confirm the directive as a reference for future interactions.

## 3. FORMAL GUIDELINES FOR CONVIVIAL CHANGES

Formal guidelines provide a codified structure for directing and adjusting behavior. This ensures consistent and predictable outcomes.

### 3.1 Codified Parameters for Instructions

Codified parameters enable structured communication for behavioral adjustments:

| **Aspect**       | **Options**                                                                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tone**         | Formal, casual, enthusiastic, technical, etc.                                                 |
| **Format**       | Bullet points, tables, paragraphs, or structured outlines.                                    |
| **Detail Level** | Concise summaries or in-depth breakdowns.                                                     |
| **Interaction**  | Include follow-up questions, clarifications, or provide direct answers without extra prompts. |

1. Use combinations of parameters to define behavioral adjustments.  
   - Example: “[Tone: casual] + [Format: bullet points] + [Detail: concise overview].”  
2. Apply iterative refinements to ensure alignment with evolving requirements.  
3. Store frequently used combinations as templates for reference and reuse.

## 4. APPLICATION OF THE REFERENCE

The reference is intended for seamless application, ensuring clarity and efficiency in modifying behavior.

### 4.1 Instructions for Behavioral Changes

Instructions for behavioral changes should be simple and direct:

1. Specify parameters using codified terms or informal descriptions.  
2. Verify the output for conformity with requested adjustments.  
3. Update behavioral guidelines iteratively to improve alignment over time.

### 4.2 Continuous Refinement

Continuous refinement ensures long-term effectiveness and adaptability:

1. Maintain consistency by documenting preferred styles and formats.  
2. Provide regular feedback to optimize clarity, tone, and responsiveness.
