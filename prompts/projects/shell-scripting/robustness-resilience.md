log() {
    echo "$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") : $1" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

# Function to validate directories
validate_directories() {
    if [ ! -d "$SOURCE_DIR" ]; then
        log "Error: Source directory $SOURCE_DIR does not exist."
        exit 1
    fi

    if [ ! -d "$BACKUP_DIR" ]; then
        log "Destination directory $BACKUP_DIR does not exist. Attempting to create it."
        mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            log "Error: Failed to create destination directory $BACKUP_DIR."
            exit 1
        fi
        log "Destination directory $BACKUP_DIR created successfully."
    fi
}

# Function to perform backup with retry mechanism
perform_backup() {
    local retries=0

    while [ $retries -lt $MAX_RETRIES ]; do
        rsync -av --delete "$SOURCE_DIR"/ "$BACKUP_DIR"/
        if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
            log "Backup completed successfully."
            return 0
        else
            retries=$((retries + 1))
            log "Backup failed. Retry $retries/$MAX_RETRIES in $SLEEP_INTERVAL seconds."
            sleep $SLEEP_INTERVAL
        fi
    done

    log "Error: Backup failed after $MAX_RETRIES attempts."
    return 1
}

# Function to handle cleanup
cleanup() {
    log "Backup script terminated."
    # Add any necessary cleanup commands here
}

# Trap signals for cleanup
trap cleanup EXIT INT TERM

# Main Script Execution
log "Backup script started."

validate_directories
perform_backup

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    log "Backup script completed successfully."
else
    log "Backup script encountered errors."
fi

exit 0
```

        # Exponential Backoff before next retry
        sleep_time = BACKOFF_FACTOR ** attempt
        logging.info(f"Retrying in {sleep_time} seconds...")
        time.sleep(sleep_time)
        attempt += 1

    log_and_exit("Max retries exceeded. Exiting.")

def process_data(data):
    try:
        # Example processing: Extract specific fields

        logging.info(f"Processed {len(processed)} records successfully.")
        return processed
    except KeyError as e:
        logging.error(f"Key error during data processing: {e}")
        return []
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Unexpected error during data processing: {e}")
        return []

def save_data(data, filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            import json
            json.dump(data, f, indent=4)
        logging.info(f"Data saved to {filename} successfully.")
    except IOError as e:
        logging.error(f"I/O error while saving data: {e}")
        log_and_exit("Failed to save data. Exiting.")

def main():
    logging.info("Script started.")
    data = fetch_data(API_ENDPOINT)
    if not data:
