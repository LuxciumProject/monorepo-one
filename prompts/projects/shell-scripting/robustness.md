## **8. Hands-On Examples and Demonstrations**

### **Example 1: Robust Bash Script for File Synchronization**

**Scenario:** A Bash script synchronizes files from a source directory to a destination directory. It needs to handle cases where files may be missing, directories may not exist, or permissions are inadequate.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/source"
DEST_DIR="/path/to/destination"
LOG_FILE="/path/to/sync.log"

# Function to log messages
log() {
    echo "$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") : $1" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

# Function to validate directories
validate_directories() {
    if [ ! -d "$SOURCE_DIR" ]; then
        log "Error: Source directory $SOURCE_DIR does not exist."
        exit 1
    fi

    if [ ! -d "$DEST_DIR" ]; then
        log "Destination directory $DEST_DIR does not exist. Attempting to create it."
        mkdir -p "$DEST_DIR"
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            log "Error: Failed to create destination directory $DEST_DIR."
            exit 1
        fi
        log "Destination directory $DEST_DIR created successfully."
    fi
}

# Function to synchronize files
sync_files() {
    rsync -av --delete "$SOURCE_DIR"/ "$DEST_DIR"/
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        log "File synchronization completed successfully."
    else
        log "Error: File synchronization encountered issues."
    fi
}

# Function to handle cleanup
cleanup() {
    log "Cleanup initiated."
    # Add any necessary cleanup commands here
    log "Cleanup completed."
}

# Trap signals for cleanup
trap cleanup EXIT

# Main Script Execution
log "File synchronization script started."

validate_directories
sync_files

log "File synchronization script completed."
```

import csv
import json
import logging
import os
import sys

# Configuration
CSV_FILE = 'data/input.csv'
JSON_FILE = 'data/output.json'
LOG_FILE = 'logs/process.log'

# Setup Logging
logging.basicConfig(
    filename=LOG_FILE,
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s:%(message)s'
)

def validate_file(file_path):
    if not os.path.isfile(file_path):
        logging.error(f"File {file_path} does not exist.")
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        logging.info(f"File {file_path} found.")

def extract_data(csv_path):
    data = []
    try:
        with open(csv_path, mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as csvfile:
            reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
            for row in reader:
                # Example validation: Ensure required fields are present
                if 'id' not in row or 'value' not in row:
                    logging.warning(f"Missing fields in row: {row}")
                    continue
                data.append(row)
        logging.info(f"Extracted {len(data)} records from {csv_path}.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error reading CSV file: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)
    return data

def process_data(data):
    processed = []
    try:
        for item in data:
            # Example processing: Convert 'value' to integer
            try:
                item['value'] = int(item['value'])
                processed.append(item)
            except ValueError:
                logging.warning(f"Invalid value for ID {item.get('id')}: {item.get('value')}")
        logging.info(f"Processed {len(processed)} records successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error processing data: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)
    return processed

def save_data(data, json_path):
    try:
        with open(json_path, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as jsonfile:
            json.dump(data, jsonfile, indent=4)
        logging.info(f"Data saved to {json_path} successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error writing JSON file: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

def main():
    logging.info("Data extraction and processing script started.")
    
    validate_file(CSV_FILE)
    raw_data = extract_data(CSV_FILE)
    processed_data = process_data(raw_data)
    save_data(processed_data, JSON_FILE)
    
    logging.info("Data extraction and processing script completed successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation:**
