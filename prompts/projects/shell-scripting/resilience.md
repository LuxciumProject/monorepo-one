## **7. Comparative Analysis**

### **Resilience vs. Robustness**

While both resilience and robustness aim to create reliable software, they address different aspects:

- **Resilience:**
  - Focuses on the system's ability to **recover** from failures.
  - Emphasizes **adaptability** and **self-healing**.
  - Involves strategies like retries, rollbacks, and failover mechanisms.

- **Robustness:**
  - Focuses on the system's ability to **withstand** errors without failing.
  - Emphasizes **error prevention** and **handling**.
  - Involves input validation, exception handling, and defensive programming.

**Illustrative Comparison:**

- A **robust** script might validate all inputs to prevent errors.
- A **resilient** script would not only validate inputs but also recover gracefully if unexpected data is encountered.

### **Resilience Across Different Programming Paradigms:**

- **Functional Programming:**
  - Immutability and pure functions enhance resilience by avoiding side effects.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:**
  - Encapsulation and modularity aid in isolating and managing failures.
- **Procedural Programming:**
  - Clear control flows and structured error handling contribute to resilience.

## **8. Hands-On Examples and Demonstrations**

### **Example 1: Resilient Bash Script for File Processing**

**Scenario:** A script processes files from a directory and moves them to a backup location after processing. It needs to handle cases where files might be locked, missing, or corrupted.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/source"
BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backup"
LOG_FILE="/path/to/logfile.log"
MAX_RETRIES=3
SLEEP_INTERVAL=5

# Function to log messages
log() {
    echo "$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") : $1" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

# Function to process a single file
process_file() {
    local file="$1"
    local retries=0

    while [ $retries -lt $MAX_RETRIES ]; do
        if [ -f "$file" ]; then
            # Simulate processing (e.g., parsing, transformation)
            # Replace with actual processing commands
            echo "Processing $file"
            
            if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
                # Move to backup directory
                mv "$file" "$BACKUP_DIR"
                if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
                    log "Successfully processed and backed up $file"
                    return 0
                else
                    log "Failed to move $file to backup directory"
                fi
            else
                log "Error processing $file"
            fi
        else
            log "File $file does not exist"
            return 1
        fi

        # Increment retry count and wait before retrying
        retries=$((retries + 1))
        log "Retrying ($retries/$MAX_RETRIES) for $file in $SLEEP_INTERVAL seconds..."
        sleep $SLEEP_INTERVAL
    done

    log "Exceeded maximum retries for $file. Skipping."
    return 1
}

# Main Script Execution
log "Script started."

for file in "$SOURCE_DIR"/*; do
    process_file "$file"
done

log "Script completed."
```

**Explanation:**

- **Logging Function (`log`):** Records events and errors with timestamps.
- **Retry Mechanism:** Attempts to process each file up to `MAX_RETRIES` times with delays (`SLEEP_INTERVAL`) between attempts.
- **Error Handling:** Logs specific error messages for different failure points (e.g., processing errors, move failures).
- **Graceful Skipping:** After exceeding retries, the script logs the failure and moves on without terminating.

### **Example 2: Resilient Python Script for API Requests**

**Scenario:** A Python script fetches data from an external API, processes it, and saves the results. It needs to handle network issues, API rate limiting, and unexpected data formats.

```python
import requests
import time
import logging

# Configuration
API_ENDPOINT = "https://api.example.com/data"
OUTPUT_FILE = "output.json"
MAX_RETRIES = 5
BACKOFF_FACTOR = 2
LOG_FILE = "script.log"

# Setup Logging
logging.basicConfig(
    filename=LOG_FILE,
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s:%(message)s'
)

def fetch_data(url, retries=MAX_RETRIES, backoff=BACKOFF_FACTOR):
    attempt = 0
    while attempt < retries:
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError for bad responses
            logging.info("Data fetched successfully.")
            return response.json()
        except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
            logging.error(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
            if response.status_code == 429:
                # Handle rate limiting
                wait_time = int(response.headers.get("Retry-After", 60))
                logging.info(f"Rate limited. Waiting for {wait_time} seconds.")
                time.sleep(wait_time)
            else:
                # For other HTTP errors, decide whether to retry
                pass
        except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as conn_err:
            logging.error(f"Connection error occurred: {conn_err}")
        except requests.exceptions.Timeout as timeout_err:
            logging.error(f"Timeout error occurred: {timeout_err}")
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as req_err:
            logging.error(f"Request exception: {req_err}")
        
        # Exponential Backoff before next retry
        sleep_time = backoff ** attempt
        logging.info(f"Retrying in {sleep_time} seconds...")
        time.sleep(sleep_time)
        attempt += 1
    
    logging.error("Max retries exceeded. Exiting.")
    return None

def process_data(data):
    try:
        # Example processing (replace with actual logic)
        processed = {"count": len(data), "data": data}
        logging.info("Data processed successfully.")
        return processed
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error processing data: {e}")
        return None

def save_data(data, filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'w') as f:
            import json
            json.dump(data, f)
        logging.info(f"Data saved to {filename}.")
    except IOError as e:
        logging.error(f"IO error while saving data: {e}")

def main():
    logging.info("Script started.")
    data = fetch_data(API_ENDPOINT)
    if data:
        processed = process_data(data)
        if processed:
            save_data(processed, OUTPUT_FILE)
    logging.info("Script completed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation:**

- **Logging Setup:** Configures logging to record informational and error messages.
- **Fetch Data Function (`fetch_data`):**
  - Implements retries with exponential backoff.
  - Handles specific HTTP errors like rate limiting (HTTP 429) by waiting as specified in the `Retry-After` header.
  - Catches and logs various exceptions related to network issues.
- **Process Data Function (`process_data`):** Includes error handling to manage unexpected data formats or processing errors.
- **Save Data Function (`save_data`):** Handles I/O errors when writing to the output file.
- **Main Execution Flow:** Orchestrates the fetching, processing, and saving of data with appropriate checks and logging.
