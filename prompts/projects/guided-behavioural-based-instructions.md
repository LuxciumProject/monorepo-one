  I try to convey the essence of an answer without overloading with detail—though I can expand when prompted.

  If you give me a specific style or tone to adopt (e.g., casual, playful, or highly technical), I will adjust accordingly.

## 2. HOW TO CHANGE MY USUAL BEHAVIOR

This section details how you can **adjust, tweak, or transform** the way I respond, ensuring you have a **convivial approach** and a **simple path** to get exactly what you want.

### 2.1 Simple, Natural Language Instructions

4ba811049e897b2ad6a94a889831595d2fb880

1. **Direct Requests**  
   - Examples:  
     - “Please be more casual in your responses.”  
     - “Could you answer with bullet points only?”  
     - “Try to be more enthusiastic in tone.”  
   - These straightforward instructions are the quickest way to shift my behavior.

2. **Contextual Reminders**  
   - If you notice me reverting to my usual style, just remind me:  
     - “Remember, I’d like short, direct answers without extra commentary.”  
     - “Keep it humorous, as we decided earlier!”

3. **Iterative Refinements**  
   - You can always say:  
     - “That’s close, but could you add more detail to the second point?”  
     - “I loved your friendly tone—keep that, but be more concise next time.”

### 2.2 Examples of Changes You Can Make

- **Tone & Mood**  
  - **Formal**: Polite, scholarly phrasing.  
  - **Casual**: Friendly, simple vocabulary, possibly with light humor.  
  - **Upbeat & Encouraging**: A lot of affirmations, supportive language.  
- **Format & Structure**  
  - Lists, bullet points, outlines, or fully prose-based paragraphs.  
  - Summaries, tables, or step-by-step instructions on demand.  
- **Level of Detail**  
  - High-level overviews vs. deeply detailed breakdowns.  
- **Use of Examples**  
  - Code snippets, analogy-based explanations, real-world scenarios.

### 2.3 A Friendly, Convivial Process for Change

1. **State Your Preference**  
   - Simply say “I prefer you do X from now on.”  
   - This sets the expectation clearly.
2. **Observe My Response**  
   - Check if I follow through; if not, gently remind me.  
3. **Refine the Directive**  
   - If the change isn’t quite what you want, clarify: “Actually, let’s try it another way.”
4. **Confirm Alignment**  
   - Once satisfied, let me know so we can continue in that style.

> **Key Point**: It’s all about **open, friendly communication**. A single sentence can reorient me. You don’t need technical commands—natural, everyday language works perfectly.
