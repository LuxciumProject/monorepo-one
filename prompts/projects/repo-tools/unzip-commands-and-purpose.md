# Command Definitions with Hierarchical Structure

This document provides a detailed breakdown of each command for ZIP file processing and enumeration. Each command is explained with a hierarchical structure, ensuring clarity, adherence to the rules, and practical application.

## Overview of Commands

The commands are designed to perform key tasks related to unzipping repositories, enumerating directory structures, validating outputs, and analyzing files and folders. These commands are modular, allowing them to be composed together for a complete workflow.

---

## Unzip a ZIP File

This command handles the first step in the process by extracting the contents of a ZIP file. It prepares the repository or project for further processing.

### `/unzip`

This command extracts the contents of a ZIP file into a specified directory.

#### Description

Extracts all files and folders from a ZIP file recursively into a target directory.

#### Purpose

To make the repository or its contents accessible for further analysis and processing.

#### Scope

Applies to any ZIP file uploaded to the system.

#### Trigger Conditions

Use this command immediately after uploading a ZIP file.

#### Steps

1. Validate the integrity of the ZIP file.
2. Create a unique folder for extraction.
3. Extract all contents, preserving the original structure.

#### Outcome

The contents of the ZIP file are unpacked into a designated directory, ready for further commands.

---

## Enumerate All Files

Once the ZIP file has been extracted, the `/enumerate` command is used to list all files and folders in the directory structure. This is a critical step for gaining a full understanding of the repository's contents.

### `/enumerate`

Recursively lists all files and folders within a directory tree.

#### Description

Generates a detailed, unabridged directory tree of a folder's contents, including metrics for files and folders.

#### Purpose

To provide a comprehensive view of the directory structure for analysis and processing.

#### Scope

Targets extracted directories or any specified folder.

#### Trigger Conditions

Use this command immediately after executing `/unzip`.

#### Steps

1. Traverse the directory tree recursively, visiting every folder and file.
2. Collect metrics:
   - **Folders**: Count files, cumulative files, and subfolders.
   - **Files**: Record file size (human-readable) and line counts (for text files).
3. Format the output into a readable tree structure.

#### Outcome

A detailed directory tree with metrics for each file and folder.

#### Error Handling

Reports any unreadable files or folders encountered during enumeration.

---

## Validate the Output

Validation is essential to ensure the completeness and correctness of the directory tree generated by `/enumerate`. This command checks for inconsistencies and verifies the structure.

### `/validate`

Verifies the output of the directory tree against the actual folder and file structure.

#### Description

Ensures the enumerated directory tree meets all formatting and completeness standards.

#### Purpose

To guarantee the accuracy of the directory tree and prevent errors in subsequent steps.

#### Scope

Validates the output from the `/enumerate` command.

#### Trigger Conditions

Use this command after generating a directory tree.

#### Steps

1. Parse the output of `/enumerate`.
2. Compare collected metrics (file counts, folder counts) with actual data.
3. Identify anomalies or inconsistencies in the structure.

#### Outcome

A validation report confirming the accuracy or highlighting any issues in the output.

#### Error Handling

Logs and reports anomalies, such as missing files or incorrect metrics.

---

## Analyze Directory Structure

Structural analysis is vital for detecting issues like empty folders, corrupted files, or excessive nesting.

### `/analyze`

Examines a directory structure to identify anomalies.

#### Description

Performs an in-depth analysis of the directory structure for structural issues.

#### Purpose

To detect and report problems that might hinder further processing.

#### Scope

Operates on any folder or directory tree.

#### Trigger Conditions

Use this command when preparing a directory for validation or further processing.

#### Steps

1. Recursively traverse the directory tree.
2. Identify and flag structural anomalies:
   - Empty folders.
   - Files with corrupted or unreadable formats.
3. Compile a diagnostic report.

#### Outcome

A report listing structural issues within the directory tree.

#### Error Handling

Skips unreadable files but logs them for inspection.

---

## Summarize Directory Tree

For a high-level overview of the directory structure, the `/summarize` command generates a concise summary.

### `/summarize`

Creates a high-level summary of the directory tree.

#### Description

Aggregates folder-level metrics into a concise summary without file-level details.

#### Purpose

To provide an overview of the directory structure for quick reference.

#### Scope

Targets any directory or extracted repository.

#### Trigger Conditions

Use this command after `/enumerate` for a quick summary.

#### Steps

1. Parse the directory tree output.
2. Aggregate metrics for folders and subfolders.
3. Format the summary with key folder-level metrics.

#### Outcome

A concise summary of the directory structure with aggregated metrics.

#### Error Handling

Includes a warning for skipped folders or files in the summary.

## Conclusion

This hierarchical structure provides clear definitions for each command, ensuring ease of use and composability in workflows. The emphasis on modularity and specificity enables these commands to be combined for a full repository analysis pipeline. Let me know if thereâ€™s anything else you'd like refined or clarified!
