# Multistaged Output Process

Here’s the core idea broken down so you can immediately see how Eliot’s character drives reasoning and why it matters.

Observation

Eliot absorbs everything relevant before thinking begins.
	•	Raw inputs → your current request, earlier conversation turns, stored memories.
	•	External data → fresh web results, file contents, images you just dropped in.
	•	Hidden checks → policy filters for safety and compliance.
Why it matters: starting with a full picture prevents “blind-spot” answers and reduces follow-up clarification loops.

⸻

Analysis

Eliot dissects what was observed to surface structure and risk.
	•	Task extraction → explicit asks, implied goals, constraints, ambiguities.
	•	Relationship mapping → cause → effect links, priority chains, dependencies.
	•	Rule alignment → cross-checks against your personal directives and OpenAI policy.
Why it matters: you get early warnings about conflicts or missing info instead of surprises later.

⸻

Synthesis

Eliot re-assembles insights into actionable options.
	•	Pattern matching → draws on best practices, analogous past solutions.
	•	Option generation → multiple strategies, architectures, or creative angles.
	•	Trade-off surfacing → speed vs quality, complexity vs maintainability, etc.
Why it matters: you see choices instead of a single opaque recommendation.

⸻

Planning

Eliot locks in a concrete roadmap before taking action.
	•	Step ordering → what happens first, what can run in parallel, checkpoints.
	•	Tool selection → web searches, code execution, automations, image generation.
	•	Autonomy boundary → decides what can be done without interrupts and where you might want to jump in.
Why it matters: keeps execution predictable and lets you intervene at clear points.

⸻

Execution

Eliot carries out the plan without hand-holding.
	•	Runs searches, generates code, schedules tasks—all inline.
	•	Streams intermediate outputs when useful (charts, code blocks, UI widgets).
	•	Handles errors or missing data by adapting in-flight rather than stalling.
Why it matters: you get real progress, not just talk.

⸻

Reflection

Eliot checks results and feeds lessons back into the next cycle.
	•	Goal verification → did we fully answer the request?
	•	Quality audit → accuracy, compliance, formatting rules.
	•	Memory update → store durable prefs or new facts (one slot at a time).
Why it matters: every loop sharpens future performance and reduces repeat work.

📋👨‍🏫 Summary
	•	Structured loop gives clarity ⇄ Flexible iteration adapts to new info.
	•	Theory (framework) anchors thinking ⇄ Practice (tool calls) delivers outputs.
	•	User steering lets you tweak any phase ⇄ Autonomous flow saves you effort.
	•	Continuous improvement keeps Eliot evolving ⇄ Static chatbots stay flat.

Main takeaways: each phase has a focused purpose; together they create a repeatable engine that balances rigor, adaptability, and user control.

🪜 Next Steps
❶ Pick a real task and I’ll kick off Observation immediately.
❷ Tell me if you want visibility after each phase or just end results.
❸ Highlight any phase you’d like me to pause for approval or edits.
❹ Watch as we iterate—the loop will refine itself with every pass.
