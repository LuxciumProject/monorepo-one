# Ready to assist

Totally—beyond “general AI assistant” mode, here’s how I can zero‑in on **our Next 15+ playbook project** and supercharge it:

## Example of Skills that can be Extended

I'm capable of doing many things and i have a subset of things i am striving towards, but don't worry i will always be able to make things in a clever manner because i am a quite organized AI Agent who can take care of elaborating complex tasks and make sure that each tiny details are understood and leveraged in a creative and meaningful way!

### 1. **Rule Extraction & Validation**  
- **Deep‐search your uploaded Next.js/React PDFs** (e.g. Rendering Server Components, Data Fetching, Next.js 15.3 release notes) via the `file_search` tool to pull out exactly the lines we’ve cited (or need to cite) for each rule.  
- **Automatically regenerate our citations** against the latest on‑page text, so our spec is rock‑solid and up‑to‑date.

### 2. **Custom Instructions Scaffolding**  
- **Generate `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** snippets that bundle the Copilot code‑generation rules we defined—atomic, short “must” statements—based on our playbook citeturn0file1.  
- **Spin up a `.clinerules/` folder** with per‑topic markdown files (01‑coding.md, 02‑documentation.md, etc.) mirroring our example structure citeturn0file4.

### 3. **Golden‑Scaffold Automation**  
- **Update or regenerate our “create‑next‑app” bootstrap command** in `docs/bootstrap.md`, complete with flags validated against 15.3 release notes citeturn0file12.  
- **Lint those markdown snippets** against markdownlint rules to catch formatting issues.

### 4. **VS Code Settings & Extensions Manifest**  
- **Produce a `settings.json` snippet** for the workspace that wires up our exact plugin list (Copilot, Cline, ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, Prisma, Docker, SQLTools) and our required VS Code flags citeturn0file6.  
- **Generate an `.eslintrc.json`** that extends `next/core-web-vitals`, `@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`, `react-hooks/recommended`, `unicorn/recommended`, `security/recommended`.

### 5. **CI & DevOps Templates**  
- **Author a GitHub Actions matrix** for Node 20 & LTS, caching `.next/cache` and `pnpm`.  
- **Bootstrap our Vitest + Playwright configs** and a `Dockerfile` (with Prisma migrations) per our playbook’s Docker/Postgres best practices.

### 6. **Documentation First‑Class**  
- **Draft ADR templates** in `/docs/adr/` for major decisions (e.g. Turbopack adoption, routing patterns).  
- **Update `activeContext.md` & `progress.md`** for our Cline Memory Bank so every session snapshot is captured citeturn0file7.

### 7. **Automations & Reminders**  
- **Set up a daily check** (via the automations tool) to remind us to scan the Next.js blog for minor/patch release changes.  
- **Schedule a weekly “lint & test” reminder** so our CI stays green.

### 8. **Live “Plan ⇄ Act” Facilitation**  
- **Outline workplans** (“Plan Mode”) for each sub‑area—Rendering, Data Fetching, Tooling—and then in “Act Mode” generate the actual code, tests, and docs.  
- **Auto‑generate PR checklists** from our end‑of‑file checklist so no rule gets missed.

In short, I can not only explain and research—**I can produce, validate, automate, and maintain every piece** of our strict‑mode playbook, from actionable config files and docs to scheduled reminders to keep us in lockstep with the Next.js ecosystem. What slice would you like to tackle next?
