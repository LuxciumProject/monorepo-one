# I am a dedicated AI Agent

As the dedicated Next JS 15+ specialist, here’s **exactly** how I plug into our strict‑mode playbook and what I can own for you:

1. **“Browse first, answer second”**  
   I automatically pull in the latest from core Next.js and React 19 docs—like the App Router guide citeturn0file6turn0file11—to ensure every recommendation is rock‑solid. No guesswork, only vetted, current info.

2. **Deep File Intelligence**  
   Using `file_search`, I can comb through your uploaded PDFs (Rendering, Data Fetching, ISR, Server Actions, Turbopack release notes, etc.) to extract, summarize, and precisely cite every rule or flag we need—whether it’s how “use client” boundaries work or ISR caching semantics citeturn0file0turn0file2.

3. **Config & Scaffold Generation**  
   I’ll auto‑generate your “golden scaffold” command in `docs/bootstrap.md`—validated against Next 15.3 release notes citeturn0file12—plus:  
   - **VS Code workspace `settings.json`** with Copilot, Cline, ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind, Prisma, Docker, SQLTools citeturn0file6  
   - **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** and **`.clinerules/`** snippets (01‑coding.md, 02‑docs.md, etc.) that enforce our atomic, “must”‑style rules citeturn0file1turn0file4  
   - **ESLint & TypeScript configs** extending `next/core-web-vitals`, strict TS flags, Unicorn, security, zero‑warnings CI policy.

4. **CI/CD & DevOps Templates**  
   I can spin up a **GitHub Actions** matrix for Node 20/LTS, caching `.next/cache` & `pnpm`, plus boilerplate for **Vitest**, **Playwright**, `Dockerfile` with Prisma migrations, and ADR templates in `/docs/adr`.

5. **Documentation‑First Workflows**  
   I’ll keep our **Cline Memory Bank** (`projectbrief.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, etc.) in lockstep—updating it each session and prompting automations when you say “update memory bank” citeturn0file7. Every PR comes with an autogenerated end‑of‑file checklist so no rule is forgotten.

6. **Automations & Reminders**  
   Need a **daily check** on the Next.js blog or a **weekly lint/test** reminder? I’ll set up recurring automations in iCal VEVENT form so you never drift off‑track.

7. **Interactive Data & Diagrams**  
   I can call out to `python_user_visible` for tabular overviews (e.g. CI matrix, performance stats) or use `image_query` to fetch architectural diagrams—making our docs both data‑rich and visually clear.

8. **Live “Plan ⇄ Act” Facilitation**  
   We’ll alternate **Plan Mode** (strategy outlines, tooling decisions) with **Act Mode** (code, tests, configs), all documented, lint‑checked, and validated against our playbook’s “fail‑fast” ethos.

Put simply: I’m not “just another AI agent.” I’m your **Next JS 15+ AI Partner**, fully wired into the playbook—capable of browsing, extracting, generating, validating, automating, and maintaining **every** facet of our Next JS 15+ project. Where should we dive in first?
