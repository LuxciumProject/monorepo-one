## 6. Plasma Desktop Customizations

Plasma allows extensive visual customization. This section covers themes, colors, icons, and cursors.

### 6.1 Global Themes and Color Schemes

- **Global Themes:**  
  Themes are stored in:
  - System-wide: `/usr/share/plasma/desktoptheme/`
  - User-specific: `~/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme/`

  Copy an existing theme, modify its QML and SVG assets, and update `metadata.json`.  
  _Reference:_ [Plasma Desktop Theme Documentation](https://develop.kde.org/plasma/desktop/) citeturn0search10

- **Color Schemes:**  
  Define system colors in `.colors` files located in:
  - `/usr/share/color-schemes/`
  - `~/.local/share/color-schemes/`

  Edit these files to change palettes across the desktop.  
  _Reference:_ [KDE Color Schemes Wiki](https://community.kde.org/Plasma/ColorSchemes)

### 6.2 Icon and Cursor Themes

- **Icon Themes:**  
  Managed via directories:
  - System: `/usr/share/icons/`
  - User: `~/.local/share/icons/`

  Configured similarly and selected through System Settings.

---

## 7. Developing and Modifying Plasma Plasmoids

Plasmoids are modular widgets for your desktop and panels.

### 7.1 Anatomy of a Plasmoid

A typical plasmoid package contains:
- **Metadata File:**  
  `metadata.desktop` or `metadata.json` with properties such as Name, Description, Authors, and Plugin ID.  
  _Reference:_ [Plasma Plasmoids Documentation](https://develop.kde.org/plasma/plasmoids/)

- **UI Definition:**  
  QML files (commonly in `contents/ui/`), which define the visual interface.

- **Optional Logic:**  
  JavaScript files to handle interactions and dynamic behavior.

### 7.2 Building and Testing Your First Plasmoid

1. **Create the Directory Structure:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/plasma/plasmoids/org.example.myplasmoid/contents/ui
   ```

2. **Example `metadata.desktop`:**

   ```ini
   [Desktop Entry]
   Name=My Custom Plasmoid
   Comment=A simple example plasmoid for Plasma
   Icon=utilities-terminal
   Type=Service
   X-KDE-ServiceTypes=Plasma/Applet
   X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name=org.example.myplasmoid
   X-KDE-PluginInfo-Version=1.0
   X-KDE-PluginInfo-Author=Your Name
   X-KDE-PluginInfo-Website=https://github.com/username/myscript
   ```

3. **Example `main.qml`:**

   ```qml
   import QtQuick 2.15
   import org.kde.plasma.core 2.0 as PlasmaCore

   Item {
       width: 200; height: 100
       PlasmaCore.Label {
           anchors.centerIn: parent
           text: "Hello, KDE Plasma!"
           font.pointSize: 14
       }
   }
   ```

   _Reference:_ See the [Stack Overflow "Hello World" example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78304078/how-to-create-a-simple-hello-world-kwin-script-for-kde-plasma-6-0) citeturn0search19

4. **Testing:**  
   Reload Plasma with:

   ```bash
   plasmashell --replace &
   ```

   Then add your plasmoid via the “Add Widgets” interface.

### 7.3 Advanced Plasmoid Development

- **Property Bindings & Animations:**  
  Utilize QML’s binding features and animations for dynamic interfaces.  
  _Reference:_ [Qt QML Animation Documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-animation.html)

- **KDE Framework Integration:**  
  Integrate with APIs like KIO and KConfig.  
  _Reference:_ [KDE Frameworks API Documentation](https://api.kde.org/)

- **Debugging:**  
  Use Qt Creator’s integrated QML debugger for real-time troubleshooting.

## 8. Mastering KWin: Scripting, Effects, and Window Management

KWin is central to managing windows, effects, and overall desktop behavior.

### 8.1 Customizing Window Decorations and Aurorae Themes

- **Aurorae Themes:**  
  Edit window decorations (SVG and QML files) located in:
  - System: `/usr/share/aurorae/themes/`
  - User: `~/.local/share/aurorae/themes/`

  _Reference:_ [Aurorae Themes Wiki](https://community.kde.org/Aurorae)

### 8.2 Developing KWin Scripts

- **KWin Scripting:**  
  Write scripts in JavaScript (or QML) to adjust window behavior (e.g., tiling, auto-arrangement).

- **Example Script (Hello World):**  
  A basic script to print a message can be tested using the Plasma Desktop Scripting Console or via `qdbus`.  
  _Reference:_ [KWin Scripting Documentation](https://community.kde.org/KWin/Scripting) citeturn0search1

- **Testing:**  
  Use the interactive console (via KRunner with “wm console”) to run and debug your scripts.

### 8.3 Creating Advanced KWin Effects

- **Effect Development:**  
  Develop custom effects using C++ and OpenGL or QML shader plugins. Explore the KWin source code on [invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin).

- **Debugging Techniques:**  
  Utilize `qCDebug`, GDB, and logging tools to troubleshoot.

## 9. Working with Wayland on KDE

As KDE Plasma shifts toward Wayland, it’s crucial to understand and develop for it.

### 9.1 Understanding Wayland in the KDE Context

- **KWin on Wayland:**  
  On Wayland, KWin acts as both window manager and compositor.  
  _Reference:_ [KWin/Wayland Wiki](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/wikis/Wayland)

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Ensure `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland` and set other relevant variables (e.g., `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`).

### 9.2 Debugging and Testing on Wayland

- **Logging:**  
  Use the environment variable `WAYLAND_DEBUG=1` to output protocol messages.  
  _Reference:_ [Wayland Tutorial – A Wayland HowTo](https://grimoire.carcano.ch/blog/wayland-tutorial-a-wayland-howto/) citeturn0search9

- **Testing:**  
  Run nested sessions or switch your display manager session to Wayland.

### 9.3 Advanced Wayland Protocol Development

- **Protocol Extensions:**  
  For custom features, study the [KWayland libraries](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kwayland) and review the Wayland protocol specifications at [wayland.freedesktop.org](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/).
