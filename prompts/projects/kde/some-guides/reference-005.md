# KDE Customization and Development Reference Guide

> **Note:** This document focuses exclusively on KDE technologies (Plasma, KWin, Plasma Shell, Wayland, etc.). For authoritative sources, please refer to the [KDE Developer Portal](https://develop.kde.org/), [KDE Community Wiki](https://userbase.kde.org/), and official KDE documentation.

## 1. Introduction to KDE Plasma

### 1.1 What is KDE Plasma?

- **KDE Plasma** is a modern, flexible desktop environment built on Qt and KDE Frameworks.  
- It emphasizes modularity, enabling extensive customization through its components:
  - **Plasma Shell:** Manages panels, widgets (plasmoids), and the overall user interface.
  - **Activities and Virtual Desktops:** Let you separate workspaces by use case.
  - **System Settings:** Centralizes control over appearance, behavior, and hardware configuration.

### 1.2 Official Resources

- [KDE Plasma Official Website](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/)
- [KDE Plasma Documentation](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/)

## 2. Customizing KDE Plasma

### 2.1 Plasma Themes and Styles

- **Global Themes & Plasma Styles:**
  - Global themes bundle elements such as icon themes, desktop styles, color schemes, and panel layout templates.
  - Themes are typically found in `/usr/share/plasma/look-and-feel/` (system) or `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/` (user).
- **Icon Themes and Color Schemes:**
  - Customize icons (found in `/usr/share/icons/` or `~/.local/share/icons/`).
  - Edit color schemes (stored in `/usr/share/color-schemes/` or user directories).

### 2.2 Plasmoids (Widgets)

- **Plasmoids** are small applications (widgets) written in QML and JavaScript.
- They are available on the [KDE Store](https://store.kde.org/) and can be created or modified using the Plasma SDK.

### 2.3 Practical Steps

- **Changing Themes:**  
  Open **System Settings → Appearance** and experiment with the available Global Themes.
- **Modifying Plasmoids:**  
  Explore and edit plasmoids with QML—use tutorials such as those available on [Dedoimedo](https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/plasma-customization-guide.html) or Medium articles on KDE customization.

## 3. KWin – The KDE Window Manager

### 3.1 Overview of KWin

- **KWin** handles window management (placement, decorations, and compositing) for both X11 and Wayland sessions.
- It provides built-in effects such as Wobbly Windows, Desktop Grid, and Present Windows.

### 3.2 KWin Scripting

- **Scripting Languages:**  
  KWin can be scripted using JavaScript (or declarative QML scripts) to automate tasks such as custom tiling or window rules.
- **Script Package Structure:**
  - A typical package contains:
    ```
    myscript/
    ├── contents/
    │   └── code/
    │       └── main.js   # or main.qml
    └── metadata.json
    ```
- **Metadata Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "KPlugin": {
      "Name": "My Script",
      "Description": "Description of the script",
      "Icon": "preferences-system-windows",
      "Authors": [
        {
          "Name": "Firstname Lastname",
          "Email": "user@example.com"
        }
      ],
      "Id": "myscript",
      "Version": "1.0",
      "License": "GPLv3",
      "Website": "https://github.com/username/myscript"
    },
    "X-Plasma-API": "javascript",
    "X-Plasma-MainScript": "code/main.js",
    "KPackageStructure": "KWin/Script"
  }
  ```
- **Learning Resources:**
  - [KWin Scripting Tutorial](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/kwin/)
  - Official [KWin API documentation](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/kwin/scripting/)

## 4. Wayland Integration in KDE Plasma

### 4.1 Understanding Wayland

- **Wayland** is a modern display server protocol that offers better performance and security than X11.
- **KWin as a Wayland Compositor:**
  - On Wayland, KWin handles rendering and input; however, some X11-specific hints (e.g., `Qt.X11BypassWindowManagerHint`) do not work.
  
### 4.2 Practical Considerations

- **Testing Sessions:**  
  Compare your customizations under both X11 and Wayland.
- **Further Reading:**
  - [Qt Wayland Compositor Documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtwayland-compositor-waylandview.html)
  - KDE developer blog posts on [Wayland support](https://develop.kde.org/)

## 5. Advanced Plasma Development

### 5.1 Plasma Shell Scripting and QML Development

- **QML Fundamentals:**  
  Plasma’s user interface is built using QML. Learn layouts, data bindings, and property animations.
- **Developing Plasmoids:**  
  Use the Plasma SDK to create custom widgets. Examples and tutorials can be found on the [KDE Developer Portal](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/).
- **Practical Steps:**
  - Start with simple QML examples.
  - Gradually progress to creating fully functional plasmoids.
  - Use IDEs like **KDevelop** or **Qt Creator** for development.

### 5.2 Useful Tutorials and Resources

- [Plasma Widget Tutorial](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/)
- [Beginner’s Guide to KDE Frameworks and Plasmoids on Medium](https://medium.com/zerone-magazine/a-beginners-guide-to-kde-frameworks-and-developing-your-own-plasmoids-and-more-d09a429fc6e4)

## 6. Bundling, Packaging, and Sharing Customizations

### 6.1 Managing Dotfiles

- **Dotfiles Repositories:**  
  Use Git to manage configuration files (typically in `~/.config` and `~/.local/share`).
- **Tools:**  
  Consider tools like [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) or [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) for managing dotfiles across multiple systems.

### 6.2 Packaging KDE Components

- **KPackage Format:**  
  Package your KWin scripts or plasmoids in the proper structure for easy installation.
- **Distribution:**
  - Upload your packages to GitHub.
  - Share via the [KDE Store](https://store.kde.org/).
  - Use packaging tools like `kpackagetool6` for installing KWin scripts:
    ```bash
    kpackagetool6 --type=KWin/Script -i ~/Code/myscript/
    ```
- **Exporting Customizations:**
  - Use System Settings to export/import keybindings and other configurations where supported.

  Master the basics of [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) and [KDE Frameworks](https://community.kde.org/Frameworks) as they form the backbone of Plasma.
- **Development Environments:**
  - **KDevelop** and **Qt Creator** are highly recommended.
  - **Visual Studio Code** with KDE/Qt plugins can also be used.
- **Version Control:**  
  Git is essential—learn to use Git and GitHub for collaboration and contributions.

### 7.2 Community Resources

## 9. Additional Considerations

### 9.1 Performance and Optimization

- **Hardware Acceleration:**  
  Understand how Plasma leverages OpenGL for rendering and the differences between X11 and Wayland.
- **Security Best Practices:**  
  Some scripting APIs (especially those involving DBus) have security implications—review best practices in the [official KDE docs](https://develop.kde.org/docs/).

### 9.2 Future Trends

- **Evolving APIs:**  
  Keep an eye on developments with Plasma 6, enhanced QML scripting, and improved Wayland support.
- **Cross-Platform Development:**  
  Many KDE components are designed to be modular—this enables reuse across desktop, mobile (e.g., Plasma Mobile), and other platforms.
