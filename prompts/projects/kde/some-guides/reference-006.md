## 2. Mapping the KDE Ecosystem

### 2.1 KDE Plasma Desktop

- **Purpose & Architecture:**  
  KDE Plasma is the central desktop environment that brings together panels, widgets, and notifications, using KConfig for unified settings management.
  
- **Technical Details:**  
  - Global configuration files (e.g., `~/.config/kdeglobals`).
  - Theming is handled via scalable SVG graphics (e.g., the Breeze theme: [Breeze on invent.kde.org](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/breeze)).
  
- **Additional Considerations:**  
  - How global themes interact with Plasma styles and application styles.
  
- **References:**  
  - [Plasma DeveloperGuide](https://community.kde.org/Plasma/DeveloperGuide)

### 2.2 Plasma Shell and Plasmoids

- **Overview:**  
  The Plasma Shell is written in QML/JavaScript with C++ backends and manages the desktop UI. Plasmoids are modular widgets that extend this shell.

- **Technical Details:**  
  - Standard plasmoid package structure: `metadata.desktop`, `contents/ui`, and `contents/images`.
  - Debugging tools: plasmoidviewer, Qt Creator’s QML debugger.
  
- **References:**  
  - [Plasmoid Development Documentation](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/plasmoid/)

### 2.3 KWin: Window Management, Scripting, and Effects

- **Overview:**  
  KWin is KDE’s window manager and compositor. It manages window decorations, placement, and visual effects while offering a robust scripting API.

- **Technical Highlights:**  
  - Scripting API using JavaScript/QML; signals like `clientMaximizeSet` for property changes.
  - Log output is viewed via:
    ```bash
    journalctl -f QT_CATEGORY=js QT_CATEGORY=kwin_scripting
    ```
  
- **References:**  
  - [KWin Scripting Tutorial](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/kwin/)

### 2.4 Wayland Integration vs. X11

- **Overview:**  
  Wayland is the modern display server protocol with benefits over X11, though some customizations may require adjustments.

- **Technical Details:**  
  - Use `WAYLAND_DEBUG=1` for debugging.
  - Documented differences in behavior between Wayland and X11.
  
- **References:**  
  - [KWin/Wayland Wiki](https://community.kde.org/KWin/Wayland)

### 2.5 Additional KDE Frameworks and Libraries

- **Key Components:**  
  - **KDE Frameworks (KF5/KF6):** Modular libraries such as KIO, KWindowSystem, KXMLGUI ([API.kde.org](https://api.kde.org/)).
  - **Kirigami:** For building adaptive, responsive UIs ([Kirigami Documentation](https://develop.kde.org/docs/kirigami/)).
  - **KDeclarative & KPackage:** For bridging QML and C++ and packaging nonbinary content.

- **Best Practices:**  
  - Leverage these frameworks to write modular, maintainable code.
