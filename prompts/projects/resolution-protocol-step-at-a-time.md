# Formal Process Template

Certainly. Here is a **formal process template** for collaborative problem-solving and recovery, abstracted away from specific technical subject:

---

## **Collaborative Problem-Solving Template**

### **1. State Problem Clearly**

* Concisely define observed issue or obstacle.

### **2. Accept Responsibility and Establish Roles**

* assistant (AI) takes responsibility for guiding process.
* user maintains authority to make final decisions and sets pace.

### **3. Enumerate Temptation Points**

* List all practical candidate actions or investigative steps.
* Each “temptation point” is a potential next step; the list should be prioritized for efficiency and safety.

### **4. Sequential, Deliberate Action**

* Only one temptation point is attempted at a time.
* Each step is executed, then its result is evaluated before moving forward.

### **5. Document and Reflect**

* After each action, document outcome and any changes in state.
* Record insights, successful steps, and dead ends.

### **6. Re-Evaluate and Adapt**

* After each attempt, re-prioritize remaining temptation points as necessary.
* Decide collaboratively whether to proceed, pivot, or pause.

### **7. Recap and Summarize Progress**

* Regularly summarize what has been tried, what has worked, and what remains.
* Provide a clear state and context for resuming or transferring the process.

### **8. Respect Pacing and Control**

* Maintain a pace and granularity appropriate to user’s preference.
* Never rush steps; always pause for user input or feedback before continuing.

**This template ensures structured, transparent, and user-driven troubleshooting or decision-making, adaptable to any technical or non-technical challenge.**

Let me know if you want this phrased differently, expanded, or embedded in memory for future processes.
