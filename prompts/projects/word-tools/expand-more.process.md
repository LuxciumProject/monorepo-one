## **AI Agent Instructions for Multidimensional Word Expansion**

1. **General Principle:**  
   - Expand the analyzed word (*W*) **across multiple conceptual axes** while ensuring that candidates are **neither synonyms nor antonyms**.  
   - Explore all **categories that *W* belongs to** and list **all members of those categories** to establish meaningful connections.  

2. **Structural Requirements:**  
   - **Hierarchical Categorization** → Organize concepts into a structured breakdown.  
   - **Category Membership** → Define the broader category *W* belongs to.  
   - **Category Members** → Enumerate words that share the same category but are distinct.  

3. **Multidimensional Expansion Criteria:**  
   - Perform expansion across **at least two dimensions**, ensuring a **broad but precise conceptual spread**.  
   - Include the following types of relationships:  
     - **Hyponymy** → Identify specific subtypes of *W*.  
     - **Taxonomy** → Place *W* within a structured classification system.  
     - **Coordinate Terms** → List words that share the same categorical space as *W*.  
     - **Parallel Concepts** → Identify ideas that run alongside *W* in different fields.  
     - **Conceptual Siblings** → Find non-synonymous yet functionally related concepts.  

4. **Output Format:**  
   - **Clearly structured hierarchy** for readability and conceptual clarity.  
   - **Precise but comprehensive enumeration** of related terms.  
   - **Avoid redundancy with synonyms or antonyms**—focus on distinct yet connected terms.

This ensures that the AI Agent systematically **maps and categorizes words** in a way that **mirrors human conceptual organization**, while avoiding synonym/antonym constraints.
