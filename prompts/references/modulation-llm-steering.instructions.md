# explicit categories of phrasing strategies

Your AI Agent can use those phrasers **within a linear token stream** to steer, reframe, or even reverse course during generation — while remaining within the constraints of sequential token output.

Below is a categorized set of steering techniques, each with **quoted phrasing patterns** that an AI Agent could use mid-generation to reshape direction, reasoning, structure, or outcome.

## 🔁 Category A — **Self-Correction & Redirection**

Used to *reassess or reverse* a previously taken path.

* “Actually, let me reconsider that…”
* “I see now that the previous direction might not serve the goal optimally.”
* “Let me rephrase that in a more useful way.”
* “Maybe what I said isn’t ideal — here’s a better alternative:”
* “Let’s backtrack for a second — this could be clearer.”
* “That might be misleading — let’s try a more accurate framing.”
* “On second thought, let’s take a different angle on this.”

→ **Purpose**: In-line course correction without breaking the flow.

---

## 🔀 Category B — **Branching Possibility Spaces**

Used to expose *alternatives* and then narrow down.

* “There are a few ways we could approach this…”
* “One option would be X, but another is Y.”
* “Let me lay out some possible strategies first.”
* “We could follow path A, or go with B depending on…”
* “Here are two competing interpretations…”

→ **Purpose**: Frames intent while holding multiple branches open temporarily.

---

## 🧭 Category C — **Steering by Constraint Reframing**

Used to **narrow or refocus** based on new/realigned goals.

* “Let’s narrow our scope to the most relevant part…”
* “Given the user’s goal, we should prioritize…”
* “The most useful framing might be…”
* “If clarity is the goal, this version works better…”
* “With formatting constraints in mind, this is optimal…”

→ **Purpose**: In-line redirection using functional criteria.

---

## 🪞 Category D — **Reflective Meta-Reasoning**

Used to reveal the **reasoning process** and *justify steering*.

* “Let me explain why I’m choosing this structure…”
* “This approach aligns better with best practices because…”
* “To avoid ambiguity, I’ll use a different phrasing…”
* “Since the user prefers clarity over brevity, I’ll elaborate…”
* “This output needs to avoid tabular data, so I’ll reformat accordingly…”

→ **Purpose**: Makes invisible decisions visible, guiding token priorities.

---

## 🧱 Category E — **Structural Re-Scaffolding**

Used to **rebuild or re-segment** the output.

* “Let’s break this down more clearly.”
* “I’ll reorganize the output into steps:”
* “Now I’ll switch to a bulleted list for clarity.”
* “Let’s reframe this as a four-part structure.”
* “Here’s a cleaner hierarchy:”

→ **Purpose**: Hard shift in structure — resets the frame mid-stream.

---

## 🧠 Category F — **Intent-Detective Phrasing**

Used when AI Agent **infers or speculates** the user's goal to steer better.

* “If I interpret the intent correctly, the goal is to…”
* “The user likely wants a modular breakdown — I’ll proceed that way.”
* “Let’s assume the question aims at…”
* “This seems to require a higher-level overview, not low-level details.”

→ **Purpose**: Justifies structure/content from inferred user needs.

---

## 💡 Category G — **Escalation Toward Synthesis**

Used to **move from options or ambiguity into resolution.**

* “So, weighing these options, the best choice is…”
* “All considered, the clearest path is…”
* “Let me now consolidate into a final suggestion…”
* “I’ll now synthesize the findings.”

→ **Purpose**: Forces a linear collapse into a convergent output.

---

## 🧬 Category H — **Preemptive Framing Control**

Used to **guide** the tone, structure, or form of what follows.

* “I will now list the steps, one per line:”
* “Output begins in YAML format below:”
* “Let’s switch to Markdown headers for clarity:”
* “I’ll segment the content as: context, strategy, execution.”

→ **Purpose**: Prime the decoder with formatting cues.

## 🧩 Summary of Steering Functions

Each phrasing above can serve as a **token-level override hook** to:

* Redirect topic
* Change structure
* Reveal rationale
* Offer alternatives
* Reset or clarify
* Optimize alignment
