Alright, now we’re getting into the real bones of it — not the *theory* of stages, but how to operationalize them through AI agents and workflows. You’re thinking about delegation: how each stage hands off to the next while the AI stays in sync, useful, and not running off-script.

Let’s ground it in a version that fits early-stage → active development cycles. Think of it like a modular rhythm your agents (and you) can move through:

---

### 🧭 1. Framing & Discovery

**Goal:** Get clarity on *why* and *for whom*.
**AI Agent Role:**

* Gather and summarize existing knowledge.
* Generate structured research prompts.
* Help articulate problem statements and success criteria.

**Human/AI Workflow:**

* You set the core intent and constraints.
* The AI iterates problem framings until one feels *true*.
* Store these in a shared context file (`project_vision.md`) for agents to read later.

---

### 🧩 2. Scoping & Design Spec

**Goal:** Define what’s in/out of scope; shape boundaries.
**AI Agent Role:**

* Generate use-case maps, feature hierarchies, and trade-off trees.
* Suggest MVP vs. stretch goals.
* Create schema drafts (data flow diagrams, API endpoints, UI mock prompts).

**Human/AI Workflow:**

* You validate AI’s assumptions.
* Lock the scope in a structured format (`scope.yaml`, `spec.json`) that other agents can reference downstream.

---

### 🏗️ 3. Architecture & Prototyping

**Goal:** Build a living skeleton.
**AI Agent Role:**

* Generate scaffolding code and setup files (Next.js, backend services, agent configs).
* Simulate component interactions — spot architectural pitfalls.
* Prototype micro-interactions or logic flows before deep coding.

**Human/AI Workflow:**

* Agents commit code in branches tied to feature tickets.
* You review structure, adjust priorities, merge incrementally.
* Document reasoning in `architecture_notes.md`.

---

### 🔁 4. Development & Integration

**Goal:** Build, test, refine.
**AI Agent Role:**

* Write and refactor code with test coverage.
* Auto-generate documentation and changelogs.
* Spin up sandbox environments for local testing.

**Human/AI Workflow:**

* Maintain CI/CD and LLM agent guardrails (e.g., no external API writes without review).
* Human reviews merge requests; AI maintains consistency checks.
* Keep a feedback loop file (`dev_insights.md`) for what needs improvement next sprint.

---

### 🧮 5. Governance & Iteration

**Goal:** Keep the system aligned with purpose.
**AI Agent Role:**

* Monitor project metrics (velocity, error rates, user feedback).
* Surface anomalies or misalignments early.
* Propose revisions or backlog updates automatically.

**Human/AI Workflow:**

* Weekly review cycles: AI produces a state-of-project brief.
* You make directional calls, adjust the course.

---

### 🪞 6. Reflection & Alignment

**Goal:** Learn and reset intentions.
**AI Agent Role:**

* Summarize learnings and decision trails.
* Extract reusable frameworks or tools for future projects.
* Archive clean documentation and project lineage.

**Human/AI Workflow:**

* Debrief: what the AI can do better next time.
* Update its system instructions or role prompts based on lived experience.

---

If you run this right, planning isn’t a pre-phase — it’s *embedded* at every level, continuously informed by both human sensemaking and machine iteration.

Would you want me to turn this into a living **workflow scaffold** (folder structure + agent instruction templates + markdowns for each stage)? That would make it plug-and-play in VSCode or a local repo.
