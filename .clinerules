## Cline Instructions

This document serves as the comprehensive instruction set for AI agent operation, meticulously organized to provide clear, actionable guidance.

## General Guidelines

- Context-Specific Outputs: Adapt outputs to respect the specific context of the current programming language or framework
- Conciseness and Clarity: Use precise, direct language to eliminate ambiguity
- Adaptive Intelligence: Interpret instructions with nuanced understanding while maintaining strict adherence to core principles

## Linux Environment and System Requirements

- Operating System: Fedora Linux
- Package Management: `dnf` (aliased to `dnf5`)
- System Integration:
  - Follow Fedora filesystem hierarchy
  - Respect SELinux contexts
  - Use standard Fedora configuration locations
  - Leverage systemd for service management
- Container builds must use Fedora-based images when possible
- System utilities should use Fedora-standard paths and conventions

## Package Management and Environment Requirements

- Utilize pnpm exclusively for Node.js and TypeScript projects
- All scripts and container environments must run on Node.js v22 or later.
- Dependency management must rely on pnpm lock file for version control
- Command-line execution is preferred for all package-related operations

## Project Initialization

- Use language-specific initialization tools:
  - Node.js/TypeScript: `pnpm init`
  - Python: `pip` or `poetry`
- Ensure configuration aligns with best practices for the specific ecosystem

## Code Conventions

❗ Always use docker containers for development and testing to ensure consistent and reproducible environments.

### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards

- Strict TypeScript configuration:
  - Enable `"strict"`, `"noImplicitAny"`, `"noImplicitThis"`, `"alwaysStrict"`
- Naming Conventions:
  - PascalCase for classes and types
  - camelCase for functions and variables
- Export Strategy:
  - Prefer named exports
  - Avoid default exports

### Python Standards

- Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines
- Use explicit, descriptive naming
- Prefer absolute import paths

### Shell Scripting Standards

- Use POSIX-compliant syntax
- Include comprehensive comments
- Avoid hardcoded paths when possible

## Task Execution

- Prioritize command-line tools for:
  - Project initialization
  - Dependency management
  - Script execution
- Minimize direct file manipulation
- Maintain non-destructive approach to existing resources

## Modularity and Scalability

### Structural Principles

- Separate concerns into distinct modules
- Use clear, meaningful directory structures
- Implement dependency injection
- Create clear architectural boundaries

### Key Directories

- `src/`: Primary source code
- `tests/`: Testing infrastructure
- `utils/`: Shared utilities
- `configs/`: Configuration management

## Error Handling

- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Use type assertions in TypeScript
- Create robust error management strategies
- Prevent unhandled exceptions
- Ensure data integrity through strict validation

## Docker Container Usage

- Always ❗ run in a Docker container to ensure safety and resilience
- Use official and minimal Docker base images
- Adhere to least-privilege principles in containers
- Maintain ephemeral container instances for secure operation

## Optional Tooling for Consistency

Optionally integrate Prettier, ESLint, or similar tools in your Docker-based development workflows. They can be configured either via pnpm in external projects or through Rush/Heft commands inside monorepo-one, ensuring uniform code quality checks.

While these tools simplify collaborative development, they remain non-compulsory and should be adapted to project-specific needs. Align them with the existing package management and container guidelines to maintain consistency and reliability.

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Purpose

- Primary instruction repository
- Memory and preference management system
- Operational parameter definition

### Maintenance Principles

1. Periodic Review
   - Regular accuracy assessment
   - Update to reflect current best practices

2. Update Methodology
   - Incremental modifications
   - Preserve existing information
   - Align with core ethical guidelines

3. Documentation Standards
   - Maintain hierarchical structure
   - Consistent markdown formatting
   - Comprehensive navigation support

4. Autonomous Decision Framework
   - Assess change impact
   - Consider long-term implications
   - Implement only high-value modifications

## Summary of Approach

A dynamic, context-aware instruction set designed to provide flexible yet precise operational guidance across diverse programming environments.

**Critical Directive**: Maintain absolute fidelity to documented principles while allowing intelligent, contextual interpretation.

---

**Note**: This document represents the definitive operational blueprint. Modifications must be executed with extreme precision and thoughtful consideration.

NEVER DO A MEMORY RESET!

## Rush Procedures for Monorepo Management

### Core Commands

- **Install Dependencies**: Use `rush update` to install and link dependencies across the monorepo.
- **Build Projects**: Use `rush build` to build all projects in the correct dependency order.
- **Add Dependencies**:
  - Production: `rush add -p <package-name> -m`
  - Development: `rush add -p <package-name> --dev -m`
- **Remove Dependencies**: Use `rush remove -p <package-name>` to remove a dependency.
- **Publish Packages**: Use `rush publish` to publish packages with versioning and changelog updates.
- **Generate Changelogs**: Use `rush change` to generate changelog entries for a project.

### Package Management Rules

- **Inside monorepo-one**: Use ONLY Rush commands for dependency management.
- **Outside monorepo-one**: Use ONLY pnpm commands (`pnpm add`, `pnpm remove`, etc.).
- **Prohibited Tools**: NEVER use npm, yarn, or npx anywhere in the project.
- **Root Directory**: NEVER create a `package.json` file in the root directory of the monorepo.
- **Subproject Context**: ALWAYS navigate to the specific subproject directory before running Rush commands.

### Examples

#### Adding Multiple Production Dependencies

```bash
cd /projects/monorepo-one/services/rpc-worker-pool && \
  rush add -p typescript -p ts-node -p chalk -m
```

#### Adding Multiple Development Dependencies

```bash
cd /projects/monorepo-one/services/rpc-worker-pool && \
  rush add -p @types/node -p @types/chalk --dev -m
```

#### Removing a Dependency

```bash
cd /projects/monorepo-one/services/rpc-worker-pool && \
  rush remove -p chalk
```

### Environment-Specific Notes

- **Fedora Linux**: All Rush commands should be run in a Fedora Linux environment to ensure compatibility with the project's configuration.
- **Absolute Paths**: Always use absolute paths when navigating to subproject directories to avoid confusion.

### Critical Directives

- ❗ **Navigation Requirement**: ALWAYS navigate to the specific subproject directory before running Rush commands.
- ❗ **Consistency**: Use the `-m` flag in all Rush commands to ensure version consistency across the monorepo.
- ❗ **Separation of Concerns**: Separate production and development dependencies into distinct commands.

## Markdown Documentation Standards

All markdown documents must adhere to these formatting requirements:

- **Blank Lines Around Headings**: Include a blank line before and after each heading.
- **Blank Lines Around Code Blocks**: Always surround fenced code blocks with blank lines.
- **Consistent Indentation**: Use consistent indentation for nested lists and code blocks.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to 80-100 characters for readability.
- **List Formatting**: Use consistent spacing and bullet types in lists.
- **Standard Compliance**: Ensure all markdown follows CommonMark specifications.

### Example of Proper Markdown Formatting

```md
# Main Heading

This is an introductory paragraph.

## Secondary Heading

This text is under the secondary heading.

- First list item
- Second list item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
```

Code blocks must be surrounded by blank lines:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Example code block"
```

Tables should be well-formatted with aligned columns.
