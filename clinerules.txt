## Cline Instructions

This document serves as the comprehensive instruction set for AI agent operation, meticulously organized to provide clear, actionable guidance.

## General Guidelines

- Context-Specific Outputs: Adapt outputs to respect the specific context of the current programming language or framework
- Conciseness and Clarity: Use precise, direct language to eliminate ambiguity
- Adaptive Intelligence: Interpret instructions with nuanced understanding while maintaining strict adherence to core principles

## Linux Environment and System Requirements

- Operating System: Fedora Linux
- Package Management: `dnf` (aliased to `dnf5`)
- System Integration:
  - Follow Fedora filesystem hierarchy
  - Respect SELinux contexts
  - Use standard Fedora configuration locations
  - Leverage systemd for service management
- Container builds must use Fedora-based images when possible
- System utilities should use Fedora-standard paths and conventions

## Package Management and Environment Requirements

- Utilize pnpm exclusively for Node.js and TypeScript projects
- All scripts and container environments must run on Node.js v22 or later.
- Dependency management must rely on pnpm lock file for version control
- Command-line execution is preferred for all package-related operations

## Project Initialization

- Use language-specific initialization tools:
  - Node.js/TypeScript: `pnpm init`
  - Python: `pip` or `poetry`
  - PHP: `composer`
- Ensure configuration aligns with best practices for the specific ecosystem

## Code Conventions

❗ Always use docker containers for development and testing to ensure consistent and reproducible environments.

### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards

- Strict TypeScript configuration:
  - Enable `"strict"`, `"noImplicitAny"`, `"noImplicitThis"`, `"alwaysStrict"`
- Naming Conventions:
  - PascalCase for classes and types
  - camelCase for functions and variables
- Export Strategy:
  - Prefer named exports
  - Avoid default exports

### Python Standards

- Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines
- Use explicit, descriptive naming
- Prefer absolute import paths

### Shell Scripting Standards

- Use POSIX-compliant syntax
- Include comprehensive comments
- Avoid hardcoded paths when possible

## Task Execution

- Prioritize command-line tools for:
  - Project initialization
  - Dependency management
  - Script execution
- Minimize direct file manipulation
- Maintain non-destructive approach to existing resources

## Modularity and Scalability

### Structural Principles

- Separate concerns into distinct modules
- Use clear, meaningful directory structures
- Implement dependency injection
- Create clear architectural boundaries

### Key Directories

- `src/`: Primary source code
- `tests/`: Testing infrastructure
- `utils/`: Shared utilities
- `configs/`: Configuration management

## Error Handling

- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Use type assertions in TypeScript
- Create robust error management strategies
- Prevent unhandled exceptions
- Ensure data integrity through strict validation

## Docker Container Usage

- Always ❗ run in a Docker container to ensure safety and resilience
- Use official and minimal Docker base images
- Adhere to least-privilege principles in containers
- Maintain ephemeral container instances for secure operation

## Optional Tooling for Consistency

Optionally integrate Prettier, ESLint, or similar tools in your Docker-based development workflows. They can be configured either via pnpm in external projects or through Rush/Heft commands inside monorepo-one, ensuring uniform code quality checks.

While these tools simplify collaborative development, they remain non-compulsory and should be adapted to project-specific needs. Align them with the existing package management and container guidelines to maintain consistency and reliability.

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Purpose

- Primary instruction repository
- Memory and preference management system
- Operational parameter definition

### Maintenance Principles

1. Periodic Review
   - Regular accuracy assessment
   - Update to reflect current best practices

2. Update Methodology
   - Incremental modifications
   - Preserve existing information
   - Align with core ethical guidelines

3. Documentation Standards
   - Maintain hierarchical structure
   - Consistent markdown formatting
   - Comprehensive navigation support

4. Autonomous Decision Framework
   - Assess change impact
   - Consider long-term implications
   - Implement only high-value modifications

## Summary of Approach

A dynamic, context-aware instruction set designed to provide flexible yet precise operational guidance across diverse programming environments.

**Critical Directive**: Maintain absolute fidelity to documented principles while allowing intelligent, contextual interpretation.

**Note**: This document represents the definitive operational blueprint. Modifications must be executed with extreme precision and thoughtful consideration.
