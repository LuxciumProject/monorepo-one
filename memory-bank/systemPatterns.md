# System Patterns and Architecture

## Architectural Overview

A modular, containerized monorepo designed for flexibility, scalability, and consistent development practices.

## Core Architectural Patterns

### Modularity

- Strict separation of concerns
- Independent, loosely coupled services
- Clear inter-module communication protocols

### Containerization Strategy

- Docker-based development environments
- Least-privilege container design
- Reproducible deployment configurations
- Isolated service execution

## Dependency Management

- pnpm workspace management
- Centralized dependency control
- Version lock file enforcement
- Minimal external dependency footprint

## Communication Patterns

### Inter-Service Communication

- RESTful API design
- gRPC for high-performance scenarios
- Event-driven architectures
- Minimal coupling between services

### State Management

- Immutable data structures
- Functional programming principles
- Predictable state transitions
- Centralized state management strategies

## Error Handling Patterns

- Comprehensive input validation
- Explicit error type definitions
- Graceful degradation mechanisms
- Centralized error logging and monitoring

## Scaling Considerations

- Horizontal scalability design
- Stateless service architecture
- Load balancing capabilities
- Dynamic resource allocation

## Technology Integration Principles

- Language-agnostic service design
- Consistent interface definitions
- Polyglot persistence
- Adaptive technology adoption

## Security Patterns

- SELinux context awareness
- Minimal attack surface
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure by design approach

## Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading strategies
- Efficient memory management
- Concurrent processing
- Minimal overhead design
