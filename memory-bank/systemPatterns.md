# System Patterns and Architecture

## Repository Structure

### Directory Organization Principles

#### Primary Project Areas

Core functionality is organized into clearly defined project areas:

- `APIs/` - External/internal API integrations and implementations
- `backend/` - Server-side applications and services
- `examples/` - Reference implementations and templates
- `frontend/` - Client-side applications and interfaces
- `library/` - Reusable utilities and tools
- `services/` - Microservices and specialized services
- `infrastructure/` - Development and deployment setup

Each area contains multiple projects, with Rush managing TypeScript-based projects while allowing for other technologies as needed.

#### Support Infrastructure

Components that enable project development and maintenance:

- Version Control (`.git/`, `.github/`)
- Package Management (`.pnpm-store/`)
- Development Tools (`.vscode/`)
- Shared Resources (`common/`)
- Documentation (`memory-bank/`)
- Build Configuration (`rush.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`)

### Root Level Rules

- No node_modules directories allowed
- No package.json files allowed
- Clear separation between primary and auxiliary components
- Configuration files kept at root level

## Core Architectural Patterns

### Modularity

- Strict separation of concerns across project areas
- Independent, loosely coupled services
- Clear inter-module communication protocols

### Development Environment Strategy

- Docker-based development environments
- Least-privilege container design
- Reproducible deployment configurations
- Isolated service execution

## Dependency Management

- pnpm workspace management
- Centralized dependency control
- Version lock file enforcement
- Minimal external dependency footprint

## Communication Patterns

### Inter-Service Communication

- RESTful API design
- gRPC for high-performance scenarios
- Event-driven architectures
- Minimal coupling between services

### State Management

- Immutable data structures
- Functional programming principles
- Predictable state transitions
- Centralized state management strategies

## Error Handling Patterns

- Comprehensive input validation
- Explicit error type definitions
- Graceful degradation mechanisms
- Centralized error logging and monitoring

## Scaling Considerations

- Horizontal scalability design
- Stateless service architecture
- Load balancing capabilities
- Dynamic resource allocation

## Technology Integration Principles

- Language-agnostic service design
- Consistent interface definitions
- Polyglot persistence
- Adaptive technology adoption

## Security Patterns

- SELinux context awareness
- Minimal attack surface
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure by design approach

## Performance Optimization

- Lazy loading strategies
- Efficient memory management
- Concurrent processing
- Minimal overhead design
