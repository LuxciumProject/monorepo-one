# Project Brief: Monorepo One

## Project Overview

A comprehensive monorepo designed to consolidate multiple projects, services, and libraries into a unified development ecosystem.

## Core Structure

### Primary Project Containers

- **APIs**: External and internal API integrations
- **Backend**: Server-side applications and services
- **Frontend**: Client-side applications and interfaces
- **Library**: Reusable utility libraries and tools
- **Services**: Microservices and specialized computational services
- **Examples**: Reference implementations and templates

### Auxiliary Infrastructure

- Version Control and CI/CD (.git/, .github/)
- Package Management (.pnpm-store/)
- Development Tools (.vscode/)
- Shared Resources (common/)
- Project Documentation (memory-bank/)

## Organization Principles

1. No root-level node_modules or package.json
2. Clear separation between primary and auxiliary components
3. Consistent project container structure
4. Configuration files maintained at root level

## Key Objectives

1. Maintain a modular, scalable software architecture
2. Ensure consistent development practices across projects
3. Optimize code reuse and dependency management
4. Provide a flexible environment for diverse technological needs

## Technological Foundations

- Primary Languages:
  - TypeScript
  - Python
  - Shell Scripting
- Package Management: pnpm
- Containerization: Docker
- Development Philosophy: Modular, Scalable, Consistent

## Governance Principles

- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Comprehensive error handling
- Dependency injection
- Least-privilege container design
- Clear project boundaries

## Development Environment

- Node.js v22+
- Fedora Linux base
- SELinux context awareness
- Systemd service management
- Rush monorepo tooling

## Build and Dependency Management

- Rush for monorepo management
- PNPM for package management
- Workspace-aware dependency resolution
- Consistent versioning enforcement

## Future Expansion

- Continuous integration of new technologies
- Ongoing optimization of development workflows
- Expansion of utility libraries and services
- Enhancement of cross-project capabilities

## Constraints and Considerations

- Maintain non-destructive approach to existing resources
- Prioritize command-line tools for operations
- Ensure reproducible development environments
- Follow established directory organization principles
