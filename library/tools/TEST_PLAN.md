# Test Suite Creation Plan for `/library/tools` and Subfolders

## Purpose

This document provides a stateful, detailed plan for systematically creating and
maintaining test suites for all files in `/projects/monorepo-one/library/tools`
and its subfolders. It serves as a reference and checklist for the team.

---

## 1. Test File Placement & Naming

- **Place each test file directly alongside the file it tests.**
- **Use the `.test.ts` suffix** (e.g., `foo.ts` â†’ `foo.test.ts`).
- Do **not** place new tests in a central `test/` folder.
- Only test `index.ts` files if they contain logic (should not, per best practices).

---

## 2. Inventory & Topic Definition

- For each file, define its main topic or responsibility (e.g., "Path utilities",
  "Browser event handling").
- Maintain a table of files and their topics for reference (see below).

---

## 3. Test File Creation Procedure

1. For each `.ts` file (excluding type-only and barrel files):

  - Create a corresponding `.test.ts` file in the same directory.

2. For each export (function, class, constant):

  - Write a `describe` block for the symbol.
  - Add `it` blocks for normal usage, edge cases, error handling, and integration (if relevant).

3. Use TSDoc comments for complex test logic.

4. At the top of each test file, add a comment stating which file and topic it covers.

5. Review and refactor for clarity, isolation, and adherence to best practices.

## 5. Summary of Steps

1. **Inventory**: List all files and define their topics.
2. **Create `.test.ts` Files**: Place them alongside each source file.
3. **Write Tests**: Cover all exports, edge cases, and error handling.
4. **Document**: Add file/topic comments in each test.
5. **Review**: Ensure clarity, isolation, and adherence to best practices.

## 6. Notes

- This plan is to be updated as the project evolves.
- All contributors should reference this document before adding or modifying tests.
- For any questions or deviations, update this file with rationale and context.
