## 8. Complete Code Style Guide for GitHub Copilot

Below is a revised, consolidated Code Style Guide with no extraneous code fences, no consecutive headers without intervening text, and duplicates merged or removed.

## Introduction

This guide helps GitHub Copilot generate code that is easy to read, use, and maintain. By following these rules, the code will be simple, functional, and easy to modify, ensuring long-term quality across the team. We also enforce a rule against consecutive headers with no intervening text: each heading is followed by at least a brief introduction.

### Why This Guide?

The goal is to ensure that generated code is both human-readable and optimized for performance. It facilitates collaboration and ensures consistent best practices.

## Basic Principles

### Keep It Simple

Code should be easy to read and not overly complex. Simple code is easier to debug, test, and maintain.

### Be Consistent

Follow the same conventions throughout the codebase to ensure ease of understanding and maintenance.

### Separate Concerns

Keep logic, data, and I/O in distinct components to enforce the Single Responsibility Principle and simplify maintenance.

### Ensure Strict Modularity

Separate logic from infrastructure-related code, letting each module focus on one responsibility.

### Use Strict Typing

Leverage TypeScript's strict typing to catch potential issues early and ensure reliability.

### Make Components Small

Each code component should serve a single purpose. This ensures maintainability and simplicity in testing.

### Isolate Infrastructure

Separate core business logic from infrastructure or framework-specific code (e.g., database calls) to simplify updates.

## Barrel-Only Index Paradigm

### Strict Barrel-Only Policy

`index.ts` files are **strictly restricted** to serving as **barrel files**. They must only re-export modules within the same directory. No additional logic is permitted here.

### Named Exports Only

All exports within `index.ts` files must be **named exports**. Avoid default exports to ensure clarity and easier refactoring.

### Refactor Existing Code

If an `index.ts` file contains logic beyond aggregation, refactor it to adhere to the Barrel-Only Index Paradigm.

### Why This Paradigm Matters

This ensures a clear separation of concerns and encapsulates internal structures for cleaner imports and simpler refactoring.

## Modular Code Design

### Use Interfaces

Interfaces define clear boundaries between different parts of the system, simplifying refactoring.

### Stay Modular

Separate logic, data handling, and input/output to prevent tight coupling and simplify testing.

### Interchangeable Components

Design parts of the code, such as repositories, to be easily replaced without breaking functionality.

### Dependency Injection Patterns

Use dependency injection or abstract factory patterns for service instantiation, keeping components loosely coupled.

## Commands and Queries

### Separate Commands from Queries

Commands modify state, while queries retrieve data without side effects. Clear distinction improves maintainability.

### Example

```typescript
// Command
function addUser(userDetails: UserDetails): void {
  database.insert(userDetails);
}

// Query
function getUserById(userId: string): User | null {
  return database.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);
}
```

## Naming Conventions

### Variables

Use `camelCase` for variable names (e.g., `userName`, `totalPrice`).

### Classes

Use `PascalCase` for class names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ShoppingCart`).

### Constants

Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants (e.g., `MAX_USERS`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`).

### Files

Use `kebab-case` for filenames (e.g., `user-profile.ts`).

### Functions

Use `camelCase` for function names (e.g., `getUser`, `calculateTotal`).

### Interfaces and Types

Use `PascalCase` for interfaces and type aliases (e.g., `UserDetails`, `OrderItem`).

## Code Formatting

Below are guidelines for consistent code formatting.

### Indentation

Use two or four spaces consistently. Do not mix tabs and spaces.

### Line Length

Keep lines under 120 characters for readability.

### Quotes

Use single quotes for strings, except in JSON, which requires double quotes.

### Semicolons

Always use semicolons to terminate statements.

### Named Function Declarations

Prefer named functions (e.g., `function doSomething()`) rather than anonymous arrow functions in the top level.

### Trailing Commas

Use trailing commas in multi-line objects and arrays to simplify diffs and merges.

### Explicit Return Types

Always define return types for functions, especially in public APIs, to ensure clarity.

### No Type Assertions

Do not use `as` for type assertions. Always use proper type definitions or generics.

### No `import *` or `export *`

Explicitly name imports and exports to avoid namespace pollution and improve clarity.

## Unused Declarations and Variables

### Never Leave Variables or Parameters Dangling

If a variable or parameter is declared but not used, remove it or mark it if it will be used in the future.

### Mark Unused Variables Explicitly

If a variable is intentionally unused, prefix it with an underscore (e.g., `_unusedParam`) to indicate it is unused.

### Complete Implementation

Ensure variables and parameters serve a purpose. If needed, refactor or complete logic to maintain clean code.

## Error Handling

### Structured Error Handling

Use `try/catch` blocks to manage exceptions gracefully, providing informative messages.

### Custom Error Classes

Create custom error classes for more descriptive error handling when dealing with domain-specific issues.

### Avoid Silent Failures

Handle errors explicitly so that unexpected behavior does not go unnoticed.

### Control Error Propagation

Use custom logic or rethrow errors to ensure they do not propagate unchecked.

## Writing Quality Code

### Immutability

Prefer immutable data structures and avoid mutating shared state.

### Break Large Functions

Decompose large functions into smaller, single-purpose functions.

### Command Query Separation (CQS)

Keep methods that modify state separate from those that return data.

### Functional Programming

Use functional methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for more declarative data handling.

### Declarative Code

Focus on what the code should do rather than detailing how to do it procedurally.

### Input Validation

Validate all inputs to avoid runtime errors.

```typescript
function isValidUser(user: User): boolean {
  if (!user.name || !user.id) {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

### Asynchronous Code

Use `async/await` to avoid callback hell and improve readability.

### Isolate Business Logic

Keep core business rules free from external frameworks or infrastructure.

## Security

### User Input Validation

Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

### Authentication and Authorization

Implement robust mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive resources.

### Data Encryption

Encrypt sensitive data in transit (TLS/HTTPS) and at rest (database encryption).

### Secure Dependencies

Regularly update and audit dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

### Error Sanitization

Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.

## Optimization

### Efficient Data Structures

Use appropriate data structures (e.g., hash maps for quick lookups) to optimize performance.

### Lazy Loading

Load modules or resources only when needed to reduce initial load times.

### Optimize Re-renders

In frameworks like React, use memoization to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### Code Profiling

Regularly profile the application to identify and address bottlenecks.

## Documentation and Comments

### Use Comments Wisely

Write comments that explain *why* the code exists, not just *what* it does.

### Add Context

Provide background or assumptions behind decisions to help future maintainers.
