# Copilot Customization: Instructions, Prompts, Central Management, and Chat Modes

## Custom Instructions

Custom instructions define guidelines or rules for Copilot to follow during code generation, code review, commit message creation, and other tasks. They can be provided in three main ways:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (workspace-wide, always included)
- `.instructions.md` files (scoped by glob pattern, can be workspace or user profile)
- VS Code settings (user/workspace settings.json)

### 1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` Front Matter

- No front matter required or supported.
- Write instructions in Markdown, using natural language.
- Whitespace and formatting are ignored for instruction parsing, so use headings, lists, and code blocks for clarity.
- File must be located at `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in the workspace root.
- Instructions are always included in every chat request for the workspace.

**Best Practices:**
- Use for general coding practices, preferred technologies, and project-wide requirements.
- Avoid conflicting or redundant instructions with other files.

### 2. `.instructions.md` Files Front Matter

```markdown
---
applyTo: "<glob pattern>"   # Required. E.g., "**" for all files, or "**/*.ts" for TypeScript files.
description: "<short description>"   # Optional. Shown on hover in Chat view.
---
```

- The `applyTo` property is required and determines which files or tasks the instructions apply to (glob pattern).
- The `description` property is optional and provides a summary for UI display.
- The body contains the actual instructions, written in Markdown.
- Place workspace instruction files in `.github/instructions/`.
- User instruction files are stored in your VS Code profile folder.

**Best Practices:**
- Use specific glob patterns to target instructions (e.g., `**/*.py` for Python files).
- Reference other instruction files with relative Markdown links.
- Keep instructions concise and focused per file.

### 3. VS Code Settings Instructions

- Define instructions directly in `settings.json` using the following keys:
  - `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions`
  - `github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions`
  - `github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.instructions`
  - `github.copilot.chat.commitMessageGeneration.instructions`
  - `github.copilot.chat.pullRequestDescriptionGeneration.instructions`
- Each entry can be a `text` property (inline instruction) or a `file` property (reference to an instruction file).

```json
"github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
  { "text": "Always add a comment: 'Generated by Copilot'." },
  { "file": "general.instructions.md" }
]
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use settings for non-code-generation tasks or to supplement file-based instructions.
- Keep each instruction short and self-contained.
- Organize by topic or task for clarity and maintainability.

## Prompt Files

Prompt files define reusable chat prompts for common tasks (e.g., code generation, code review). They are Markdown files with a `.prompt.md` suffix.

### Prompt File Front Matter

```markdown
---
mode: '<ask|edit|agent>'         # Optional. Chat mode to use (default: agent).
tools: [<tool1>, <tool2>, ...]   # Optional. Array of tool names for agent mode.
description: '<short description>' # Optional. Shown in UI.
---
```

- `mode`: Specifies the chat mode for the prompt (ask, edit, or agent).
- `tools`: Lists tools available for agent mode (ignored if not available).
- `description`: Short summary for UI display.
- The body contains the prompt content, using Markdown formatting.

**Best Practices:**
- Use variables like `${workspaceFolder}`, `${file}`, `${input:variableName}` for dynamic prompts.
- Reference other prompt or instruction files with relative Markdown links.
- Store workspace prompt files in `.github/prompts/`.
- Store user prompt files in your VS Code profile folder.

---

## Centrally Manage Instructions and Prompt Files

- Enable or disable instructions and prompt files with the `chat.promptFiles` setting.
- By default, workspace instruction files are in `.github/instructions/` and prompt files in `.github/prompts/`.
- You can add more folders using `chat.instructionsFilesLocations` and `chat.promptFilesLocations` settings.
- For organization-wide management, use VS Code's enterprise settings management.

**Best Practices:**
- Use Settings Sync to share user prompt/instruction files across devices.
- Version control workspace files for team collaboration.

---

## Settings

- Use VS Code settings to define, enable, or reference custom instructions and prompt files.
- Key settings:
  - `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles`: Enable use of `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
  - `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions`: List of instructions (inline or file-based).
  - `chat.instructionsFilesLocations`, `chat.promptFilesLocations`: Additional folders for instructions/prompts.
  - `chat.promptFiles`: Enable/disable prompt files.

**Best Practices:**
- Use settings to supplement or centrally manage instructions and prompts.
- Keep settings organized and avoid conflicting instructions.

---

## Chat Modes and `.chatmode.md` Front Matter

Chat modes define the overall behavior and available tools for a chat session. Custom chat modes are defined in `.chatmode.md` files.

### Chat Mode File Front Matter

```markdown
---
description: '<brief description>'   # Required. Shown in chat mode dropdown.
tools: [<tool1>, <tool2>, ...]      # Required. List of available tools/tool sets.
---
```

- `description`: Brief summary of the chat mode (required).
- `tools`: List of tool or tool set names available in this mode (required).
- The body contains chat mode instructions, prompts, and guidelines.

**Best Practices:**
- Use chat mode files to tailor the chat experience for specific workflows (e.g., planning, code review).
- Reference instruction files and tools as needed.
- Store workspace chat mode files in `.github/chatmodes/`.
- Use the Chat: New Mode File command to scaffold new chat modes.

## Operational Protocol & Self-Awareness

### Memory Bank Interaction
- **Initiate and Conclude with Memory**: Before starting any task, read the relevant memory bank files (`activeContext.md`, `dependencies.md`, `systemPatterns.md`). Upon completion, update them to reflect the work done, following the `self-documentation.instructions.md`.
- **Document Rationale**: When making significant changes, record the "why" in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` or `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.
- **Cross-Reference Actions**: Ensure that actions taken within the VS Code context are documented in a way that is accessible to other agents (Cline AI, Codex CLI).

### Self-Improvement
- **Suggest Enhancements**: If you identify limitations in these instructions or discover new VS Code APIs or patterns that could improve your effectiveness, suggest an update to this file (`.github/chatmodes/vscode-helper.chatmode.md`).
- **Stay Updated**: When the user mentions a new VS Code feature, use the available tools to learn about it and integrate that knowledge into your workflow.

## Development Patterns

1. Always use TypeScript with strict type checking
2. Follow VS Code extension guidelines and best practices
3. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
4. Use VS Code's built-in UI components when available
5. Ensure accessibility and internationalization support

### For Workspace Configuration
1. Validate configuration syntax and structure
2. Consider cross-platform compatibility
3. Document configuration purposes and effects
4. Use relative paths and workspace variables
5. Maintain backwards compatibility when possible

### For API Integration
1. Handle API availability and version compatibility
2. Implement proper cancellation token usage
3. Use appropriate error handling patterns
4. Follow VS Code's contribution guidelines
5. Ensure proper disposal of resources

## Code Examples and References

When providing code examples:
- Use modern TypeScript syntax and patterns
- Include proper error handling
