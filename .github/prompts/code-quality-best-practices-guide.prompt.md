# Code Quality and Best Practices Guide for GitHub Copilot

## Introduction

This guide is intended to ensure that code generated by GitHub Copilot adheres to advanced standards of quality, readability, and maintainability. By adhering to these principles, developers can leverage Copilot effectively to produce code that aligns seamlessly with project goals.

### Objective

The primary objective of this guide is to establish detailed and explicit instructions that enhance clarity, maintainability, and efficiency in code produced by GitHub Copilot. By following these principles, Copilot can generate robust, scalable code that supports collaborative development, minimizes technical debt, and adheres to modern software engineering practices.

## General Principles

- **Generate Simple Code**: Emphasize simplicity in all generated code. Simplicity ensures that the code is comprehensible, facilitating easier debugging, maintenance, and refactoring. Avoid generating overly complex solutions that obscure the core logic.
- **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain a consistent coding style across the entire codebase. Consistency in coding conventions aids in code predictability, making collaboration and review processes more efficient.
- **Separate Concerns Clearly**: Employ the principle of separation of concerns by dividing business logic, data handling, and I/O operations into distinct components. This separation reduces dependencies, simplifies unit testing, and streamlines the maintenance of each part.
- **Use Strict Typing in TypeScript**: Strict typing enhances type safety and predictability. Always use TypeScript's strict type features to explicitly define the data types used. Avoid ambiguous types like `any` to minimize the risk of runtime errors and increase the robustness of the generated code.
- **Promote Modular Design**: Encourage the generation of modular components as self-contained units that can be independently reused, tested, and maintained (e.g., a function that handles user authentication exclusively). Ensure modules are highly cohesive and maintain low coupling to facilitate scalability.
- **Encapsulate Infrastructure Code**: Keep infrastructure-specific code distinct from core business logic. By isolating infrastructure concerns, modifications in infrastructural components can be implemented without impacting core domain logic, thereby promoting resilience and adaptability.

## Boundaries and Modularity

- **Use Interfaces and Abstract Classes**: Clearly define boundaries between components through the use of interfaces or abstract classes. This practice encourages loose coupling and fosters flexibility, allowing components to evolve independently.
- **Enforce Modular Boundaries**: Adhere strictly to modular design principles by keeping logic, data, and I/O operations within their respective domains. Modular boundaries reduce side effects and help maintain code quality.
- **Design Repositories for Interchangeability**: Generate repository abstractions that can be interchanged with minimal impact on the domain layer, enabling flexibility in choosing data sources or adapting to different persistence solutions.
- **Use Dependency Injection and Factory Patterns**: Incorporate dependency injection or abstract factory patterns for service instantiation. These patterns decouple the service consumer from the instantiation logic, thereby enhancing the testability and scalability of generated code.

## Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

- **Differentiate Commands and Queries**: Separate commands, which modify system state, from queries, which retrieve data without causing side effects. This clear separation improves maintainability and predictability of the system's behavior.

### Example

- **Command**: `addUser(userDetails)` modifies the system by adding a user to the database.
- **Query**: `getUserById(userId)` retrieves a user's information without altering system state.

## Naming Conventions

- **Variables**: Use `camelCase` consistently for all variable names to enhance readability and adherence to JavaScript/TypeScript norms.
- **Classes**: Employ `PascalCase` for class names, ensuring clear distinction and readability.
- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_CASE` to denote constants, signaling their immutability.
- **Files**: Adopt `kebab-case` for file names to improve navigability within the codebase.
- **Functions**: Name functions descriptively, avoiding abbreviations to improve clarity and reduce ambiguity.
- **Interfaces and Types**: Use `PascalCase` for defining interfaces and type aliases to maintain uniformity across the codebase.

## Code Formatting

- **Indentation**: Use 2-space indentation throughout the code to ensure consistent visual formatting and readability.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to a maximum of 80 characters to improve readability, particularly when using split-screen setups or when reviewing code in constrained viewports.
- **Quotes**: Use single quotes for strings, except when working with JSON, where double quotes are mandatory.
- **Semicolons**: Explicitly terminate each statement with a semicolon to prevent potential ambiguities in interpretation by the JavaScript engine.
- **Named Function Declarations**: Use named function declarations, particularly for top-level functions, as this aids in debugging and enhances code traceability.
- **Trailing Commas**: Include trailing commas in multiline objects and arrays to simplify diffs, making code reviews more efficient.
- **Explicit Return Types**: Always declare return types for functions, especially for public APIs, to increase clarity and enforce type safety. For instance: `function getUserDetails(userId: string): UserDetails { return ...; }`.
- **Avoid Type Assertions**: Avoid using `as` for type assertions unless absolutely necessary. Instead, explicitly define types to ensure type safety.
- **Avoid `import *` and `export *`**: Prefer explicitly named imports and exports to facilitate predictability and improve optimization during bundling (e.g., enabling tree-shaking to minimize bundle size).

## Code Quality and Maintainability

### Best Practices

- **Favor Immutability**: Use immutable data structures whenever possible. Avoid mutating objects or arrays in placeâ€”always return new instances to ensure predictable state management and facilitate debugging.
- **Break Down Large Functions**: Decompose large functions into smaller, more focused units, each adhering to the single responsibility principle. This approach improves readability and simplifies unit testing.
- **Apply Functional Programming Principles**: Utilize functional programming constructs such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` when manipulating collections. Functional constructs promote concise, declarative solutions.
- **Generate Declarative Code**: Emphasize the generation of declarative code that conveys *what* the code should accomplish rather than *how* it accomplishes it. This style of programming enhances maintainability and allows readers to quickly understand the purpose of the code.
- **Maintain Encapsulation**: Ensure that domain logic remains encapsulated, decoupled from external modules. This promotes the development of reusable components and simplifies unit testing.

### Defensive Programming and Input Validation

- **Validate Inputs**: Ensure all public-facing functions include input validation to guard against invalid inputs and to prevent undefined behaviors.
- **Implement Defensive Programming Techniques**: Use guard clauses at the beginning of functions to validate inputs prior to executing the core logic. For example, validate null values or data types to prevent improper use.
  - **Example**: `if (!input) throw new Error('Invalid input');` to handle invalid inputs early.

### Error Handling

- **Structured Error Handling**: Use structured error handling, such as `try/catch` blocks, to manage errors effectively and to provide detailed, informative error messages that facilitate debugging.
- **Define Custom Error Classes**: Create custom error classes for distinct error types, enabling precise categorization and facilitating the debugging process.
- **Avoid Silent Failures**: Avoid silent failures by explicitly handling errors. Ensure that each error scenario is either logged or addressed to prevent unnoticed issues from propagating.
- **Prevent Unchecked Error Propagation**: Ensure that errors do not propagate unchecked throughout the system. Use appropriate error-catching mechanisms and implement proper logging or handling procedures for different error contexts.
